<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The Lectures on which this book is founded
were delivered five-and-twenty years ago, and
were published in <span class="smcap"><small>A.D.</small></span> 1867.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> For more than twenty
years the book has been out of print, a large first
edition having been speedily sold out. No other
edition was issued owing to the fact that my publisher
soon passed into another profession. I have
often been asked to reprint it, but have always felt
that, before reprinting, I must rewrite it. Till of late,
however, I could not command leisure for the task.
But when, at the commencement of this year, the
Editor of <span class="smcap">The Expositor's Bible</span> did me the
honour to ask permission to reprint it, that he might
include it in this excellent series, I had leisure at
command, and cheerfully devoted it to the revision
of my work. Among the more recent commentaries
I have read with this purpose in view, those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
I have found most helpful and suggestive were that
of Delitzsch, that by Dr. Wright, that of Dean
Plumptre, and the fine fragment contributed to <span class="smcap">The
Expositor</span> by Dr. Perowne, the Dean of Peterborough.
In the preface to the former edition I
dwelt on my indebtedness to the commentary of
Dr. Ginsburg, published in <span class="smcap"><small>A.D.</small></span> 1861. In my judgment
it still remains by far the best, the most
thorough and the most sound. It has but one
serious defect; it is addressed to scholars, and so
abounds in learning and erudition that it can never
come into popular use. Indeed even now, although
during the last twenty years there has been an
immense advance in the study and exposition of
Holy Writ, and many able and learned men have
devoted themselves to the service of the general
public, I know of no commentary on this Scripture
which really meets the wants of the unlettered. I
cannot but hope, therefore, that <i>the Quest of the
Chief Good</i> may still serve a useful purpose, and
that, in its revised form, it may be found helpful
to those who most need help.</p>

<p>In rewriting the book I have retained as much as
I could of its earlier form, lest the vivacity of a first
exposition of the Scripture should be lost. And,
indeed, the alterations I have had to make are but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
slight for the most part, though I have in many
places altered, and, I hope, amended both the
translation and the commentary: but there are
one or two additions&mdash;they will be found on pages
20-26, and, again, in certain modifications of the
exposition of Chapter XII., verses 9-12, on pages
279-305; dealing mainly with the structure of
<i>Ecclesiastes</i>&mdash;which may, I trust, be found useful
not to the general reader alone. Since the original
edition appeared I have had to study the Book
of Job, most of the Psalms, many of the Prophetical
writings, and some of the Proverbs; and it
was inevitable that in the course of these pleasant
studies I should arrive at clearer and more definite
conceptions on the structure of Hebrew poetry.
These I now place at the service of my readers,
and submit to the judgment of scholars and critics.</p>

<p>Another and much more important result of these
subsequent studies has been that I can now speak
with a more assured confidence of the theme of
this Scripture, and of its handling by the Author.
None of the scholars who have recently commented
on the Book doubt that it <i>is</i> the quest of the chief
good which it sets forth; and though some of them
arrange and divide it differently, yet, on the whole
and in the main, they are agreed that this quest is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
urged in Wisdom, in Pleasure, in Devotion to Public
Affairs, in Wealth and in the Golden Mean; and
that it ends and rests in the large noble conclusion,
that only as men reverence God, and keep his
commandments, and trust in his love, do they
touch their true ideal, and find a good that will
satisfy and sustain them under all changes, even to
the last. The assent to this view of the Book was
by no means general a quarter of a century ago;
but it is so wide now, and is sanctioned by the
authority of so many schools of learning, that I think
no reader of the following pages need be disturbed
by misgivings as to the accuracy of the main lines
of thought here set forth.</p>

<p>Few Scriptures of the Old Testament are so
familiar to the general reader as <i>Ecclesiastes</i>; and
that mainly, I think, because it addresses itself to
a problem which is "yours, mine, every man's."
Many more quotations from it have entered into
our current speech than have been taken from <i>Job</i>,
for example, although <i>Job</i> is both a much larger and
a much finer poem than this&mdash;"the finest poem,"
as a great living poet has said, "whether of the
modern or of the antique world." It is a Book
which can never lose its interest for men until the
last conflict in the long strife of doubt has led in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the final victory of faith; and seems, in especial, to
adapt itself to the conditions and wants of the
present age. It deals with the very questions which
are in all our minds, and offers a solution of them,
and, so far as I know, the only solution, in which
those who have "eternity in their hearts" can rest.
May all who study it, with such help as the following
pages afford, find rest to their souls, and be drawn
from the heat and strife of thought into the calm
and hallowed sanctuary which it throws open to our
erring feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<h2>§ 1. <i>ON THE AUTHORSHIP, FORM, DESIGN, AND</i><br />
<i>CONTENTS OF THE BOOK.</i></h2>


<p>Those who raise the question, "Is life worth
living?" answer it by&mdash;living on; for no man
lives simply to proclaim what a worthless and wretched
creature he is. But for the most part the question is
mooted in a merely academical and not very sincere
spirit. And to the dainty and fastidious pessimist
who goes about to imply his own superiority by declaring
that the world which contents his fellows is not
good enough for him, there still seems no better reply
than the rough but rousing and wholesome rebuke
which Epictetus gave to such as he some nineteen
centuries ago, reminding them that there were many
exits from the theatre of life, and advising them, if they
disliked the "show", to retire from it by the nearest
door of escape, and to make room for spectators of a
more modest and grateful spirit.</p>

<p>Of the pessimists of his time he demands, "Was it
not God who brought you here? And as what did He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
bring you? Was it not as a mortal? Was it not as
one who was to live with a little portion of flesh upon
the earth, and to witness his administration&mdash;to behold
the great spectacle around you for a little while?
After you have beheld the solemn and august spectacle
as long as is permitted you, will you not depart when
He leads you out, adoring and thankful for what you
have heard and seen? For you the solemnity is over.
Go away, then, like a modest and grateful person.
Make room for others."</p>

<p>"But why," urges the pessimist, "did He bring me
into the world on these hard terms?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" replies Epictetus, "if you don't like the
terms, it is always in your power to leave them. <i>He</i>
has no need of a discontented spectator. He will not
miss you much, nor we either."</p>

<p>But if any man lift the question into a more sincere
and noble form by asking, "<i>How</i> may life be made
worth living, or <i>best</i> worth living?"&mdash;in other words,
"What is the true ideal, and what the chief good, of
man?"&mdash;he will find no nobler answer to it, and none
more convincingly and persuasively put, than that contained
in this Scripture, which modern pessimists are
apt to quote whenever they want to "approve" their
melancholy hypothesis "with a text." From Schopenhauer
downward, this Book is constantly cited by them
as if it confirmed the conclusion for which they contend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Taubert even going so far as to find "a catechism
of pessimism" in it. Their assumption, however,
is based on a total misapprehension of the design and
drift of Ecclesiastes of which no scholar should have
been guilty, and of which it is hard to see how any scholar
could have been guilty had he studied it as a whole,
instead of carrying away from it only what he wanted.
So far from lending any countenance to their conclusion
of despair, it frankly traverses it&mdash;as I hope to show,
and as many have shown before me&mdash;and lands us in its
very opposite; the conclusion of the whole matter with
the Hebrew Preacher being, that whoso cultivates the
virtues of charity, diligence, and cheerfulness, because
God is in heaven and rules over all, <i>he</i> will not only
find life well worth living, but will pursue its loftiest
ideal and touch its true blessedness.</p>

<p>When scholars and "philosophers" have fallen into
a mistake so radical and profound, it is not surprising
that the unlettered should have followed their leaders
into the ditch, and taken this Scripture to be the most
melancholy in the Sacred Canon, instead of one of the
most consolatory and inspiriting, for want of apprehending
its true aim. Beyond all doubt, there is a
prevailing ground-tone of sadness in the Book; for
through by far the larger part of its course it has to
deal with some of the saddest facts of human life&mdash;with
the errors which divert men from their true aim, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
plunge them into a various and growing misery. But
the voice which sinks so often into this tone of sadness
is the voice of a most brave and cheerful spirit, a spirit
whose counsels can only depress us if we are seeking
our chief good where it cannot be found. For the
Preacher, as we shall see, does not condemn the wisdom
or the mirth, the devotion to business or the acquisition
of wealth, in which most men find "the chief good and
market of their time," as in themselves vanities. He
approves of them; he shows us how we may so pursue
and so use them as to find them very pleasant and
wholesome; how we may so dispense with them, if
they prove beyond our reach, as none the less to enjoy
a very true and abiding content. His constant and
recurring moral is that we <i>are</i> to enjoy our brief day
on earth; that God <i>meant</i> us to enjoy it; that we are
to be up and doing, with a heart for any strife, or toil,
or pleasure; not to sit still and weep over broken illusions
and defeated hopes. Our lower aims and possessions
become vanities to us only when we seek in them
that supreme satisfaction which He who has "put
eternity into our hearts" designed us to find only in Him
and in serving Him. If we love and serve Him, if we
gratefully acknowledge Him to be the Author of "every
good gift and every perfect boon," if we seek first his
kingdom and righteousness; in fine, if we are Christian
in more than name, the study of this Book should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
make us sad. We should find in it a confirmation of
our most intimate convictions, and incentives to act upon
them. But if we do not hold our wisdom, our mirth, our
labour, our wealth as the gifts and ordinances of God
for our good, if we permit them to usurp his seat and
become as gods to us, then indeed this Book will be
sad enough for us, but no whit sadder than our lives.
It will be sad, and will make us sad, yet only that it
may lead us to repentance, and through repentance to
a true and lasting joy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is to be feared that the popular misconception of
this singular and most instructive Scripture goes much
farther than this, and extends to questions much more
superficial than that of the temper or spirit it breathes.
If, for example, the average reader of the Bible were
asked, Who wrote this Scripture? when was it
written? to whom was it addressed? what is its
general scope and design? his answer, I suppose, would
be: "Solomon wrote this Book; of course, therefore,
it was written in his lifetime, and addressed to the
men over whom he ruled; and his design in writing
it was to reveal his own experience of life for their
instruction." And yet in all probability no one of
these answers is true, or anywhere near the truth.
According to the most competent judges, the Book
Ecclesiastes was not written by Solomon, nor for centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
after his death; it was addressed to a generation
of feeble and oppressed captives, who had been carried
away into exile, or had lately returned from it, and not
to the free prosperous nation which rose to its highest
pitch in the reign of the Wise King. It is a dramatic
representation of the experience of a Jewish sage, who
deliberately set himself to discover and pursue the chief
good of man in all the provinces and along all the
avenues in which it is commonly sought, eked out by
what he supposed or tradition reported Solomon's
experience to have been; and its design was to comfort
men who were groaning under the heaviest wrongs
of Time with the bright hope of Immortality.</p>

<p>To scholars versed in the niceties of the Oriental
languages, the most convincing proof of the comparatively
modern date and authorship of the Book is to be
found in its words, and idioms, and style. The base
forms of Hebrew and the large intermixture of foreign
terms, phrases, and turns of speech which characterize
it&mdash;these, with the absence of the nobler rhythmic
forms of Hebrew poetry, are held to be a conclusive
demonstration that it was written during the Rabbinical
period, at a time long subsequent to the Augustan
age in which Solomon lived and wrote. The critics
and commentators whose names stand highest<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> tell us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
that it would be just as easy for them to believe that
Hooker wrote Blair's Sermons, or that Shakespeare
wrote the plays of Sheridan Knowles, as to believe
that Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes. And of course on
such questions as these we can only defer to the verdict
of men who have made them the study of their lives.</p>

<p>But with all our deference for learning, we have so
often seen the conclusions of the ripest scholars modified
or reversed by their successors, and we all know
"questions of words" to be capable of so many different
interpretations, that probably we should still
hold our judgment in suspense, were there no arguments
against the traditional hypothesis such as plain
men use and can understand. There are many such
arguments, however, and arguments that seem to be
of a conclusive force.</p>

<p>As, for instance, this: The whole social state
described in this Book is utterly unlike what we know
to have been the condition of the Hebrews during the
reign of Solomon, but exactly accords with the condition
of the captive Israelites, who, at the disruption of the
Hebrew monarchies, were carried away into Babylonia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Under Solomon the Hebrew State touched its highest
point. His throne was surrounded by statesmen of
tried sagacity; his judges were incorrupt. Commerce
grew and prospered, till gold became as common as
silver had been, and silver as common as brass.
Literature flourished, and produced its most perfect
fruits. And the people, though heavily taxed during the
later years of his reign, enjoyed a security, a freedom,
an abundance unknown whether to their fathers or
to their children. "Judah and Israel were many in
number as the sands by the sea, eating, drinking,
and making merry.... And Judah and Israel dwelt
safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree,
from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon"
(1 Kings iv. 20, 25). But as we read this Book we
gather from it the picture of a social state in which
kings were childish, and princes addicted to revelry
and drunkenness (x. 16); great fools were lifted to
high places and rode on stately horses, while nobles
were degraded and had to tramp through the mire
(x. 6, 7); the race was not to the swift, nor the battle
to the strong, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favour to
the learned (ix. 11). The most eminent public services
were suffered to pass unrewarded, and were forgotten
the moment the need for them was passed (ix. 14, 15).
Property was so insecure that to amass wealth was
only to multiply extortions, and to fall a prey to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
cupidity of princes and judges, insomuch that the
sluggard who folded his hands, so long as he had bread
to eat, was esteemed wiser than the diligent merchant
who applied himself to the labours and anxieties of
traffic (iv. 5, 6). Life was as insecure as property,
and stood at the caprice of men who were slaves to
their own lusts; a hasty word spoken in the divan of
any one of the satraps, or even a resentful gesture,
might provoke the most terrible outrages (viii. 3, 4;
x. 4). The true relation between the sexes was
violated; the ruling classes crowded their harems with
concubines, and even the wiser sort of men took to
themselves any woman they desired; while, with cynical
injustice, they first degraded women, and then condemned
them as alike and altogether bad, their hands
chains, their love a snare (vii. 26, 28; ix. 9). The
oppressions of the time were so constant, so cruel, and
life grew so dark beneath them, that those who died
long ago were counted happier than those who were
still alive; while happier than either were those who
had not been born to see the intolerable evils on which
the sun looked calmly down day by day (iv. 1-3). In
fine, the whole fabric of the State was fast falling into
ruin and decay, through the greed and sloth of rulers
who taxed the people to the uttermost in order to
supply their wasteful luxury (x. 18, 19); while yet, so
dreadful was their tyranny and their spies so ubiquitous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that no man dared to breathe a word against
them even to the wife of his bosom and in the secrecy
of the bed-chamber (x. 20): the only consolation of
the oppressed was the grim hope that a time of retribution
would overtake their tyrants, from which neither
their power nor their craft should be able to save them
(viii. 5-8).</p>

<p>Nothing would be more difficult than to accept this
as a picture of the social and political features of the
Hebrew commonwealth during the reign of Solomon,
or even during those later years of his reign in which
his rule grew hard and despotic. Nothing can well be
more incredible than that this should be intended as
a picture of his reign, save that it should be a picture
<i>drawn by his own hand</i>! To suppose Solomon the
author of this Scripture is to suppose that the wisest
of kings and of men was base enough to pen a
deliberate and malignant libel on himself, his time, and
his realm! On the other hand, the description, dark
and lurid as it is, exactly accords with all we know of
the terrible condition of the Jews who wept in captivity
by the waters of Babylon under the later Persian rule,
or were ground under the heels of the Persian satraps
after their return to the land of their fathers. In all
probability, therefore, as our most competent authorities
are agreed, the Book is a poem rather than a
chronicle, written by an unknown Hebrew author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
during the Captivity or shortly after the Return,
certainly not before <small>B.C.</small> 500, and probably somewhat
later.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Nor is this inference, drawn from the style and
general contents of the Book, unsupported by verses
in it which at first sight seem altogether opposed to
such an inference. All the special and direct indications
of authorship are to be found either in the first or in
the last chapter.</p>

<p>The very first verse runs, "The words of the
Preacher, son of David, King in Jerusalem." Now,
David had only one son who was King in Jerusalem,
viz. Solomon; the verse, therefore, seems to fix the
authorship on Solomon beyond dispute. Nevertheless,
the conclusion is untenable. For (1) in his known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and admitted works the Wise King distinctly claims
to be their author. The Book of Proverbs commences
with "The Proverbs of <i>Solomon</i>," and the Canticles
with "The Song of Songs, which is <i>Solomon's</i>." But
the book Ecclesiastes does not once mention his name,
though it speaks of a "son of David," <i>i.e.</i> one of
David's descendants. Instead of calling this son of
David Solomon, it calls him "Coheleth," or, as we
translate the word, "The Preacher." Now, the word
Coheleth<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is not a masculine noun, as the name of
a man should be, but the feminine participle of an
unused conjugation of a Hebrew verb which means
"to collect," or "to call together." It denotes, not
an actual man, but an abstraction, a personification,
and is probably intended to denote one who calls a
congregation round him, <i>i.e.</i> a preacher, <i>any</i> preacher,
preacher <i>in the abstract</i>. (2) This "son of David,"
we are told, was "King <i>in Jerusalem</i>;" and the phrase
implies that the Book was written at a time when there
either were or had been kings <i>out of</i> Jerusalem, when
Jerusalem was not the only site of a Hebrew throne,
and therefore after the disruption of Solomon's realm
into the rival kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (3) Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
we find Coheleth affirming (i. 12), "I <i>was</i> King over
Israel in Jerusalem," and (i. 16), "I acquired greater
wisdom than <i>all</i> (all <i>kings, i.e.</i>, say the critics) who
were before me in Jerusalem." But to say nothing
of the questionable modesty of the latter sentence if
it fell from the pen of Solomon, he was only the second
occupant of the throne in Jerusalem; for Jebus, or
Jerusalem, was only conquered from a Philistine clan
by his father David. And if there had been only one,
how could he speak of "all" who preceded him?
(4) And still further, the tense of the verb in "I was
King over Israel" can only carry the sense "I was
King, but am King no more." Yet we know that
Solomon reigned over Israel to the day of his death,
that there never was a day on which he could have
strictly used such a tense as this. So clear and undisputed
is the force of this tense that the rabbis, who
held Solomon to be the author of Ecclesiastes, were
obliged to invent a fable or tradition to account for it.
They said, "When King Solomon was sitting on the
throne of his kingdom, his heart was greatly lifted up
within him by his prosperity, and he transgressed the
commandments of God, gathering to him many horses,
and chariots, and riders, amassing much gold and
silver, and marrying many wives of foreign extraction.
Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against
him, and He sent against him Ashmodai, the ruler of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the demons; and he drave him from the throne of
his kingdom, and took away the ring from his hand
(Solomon's ring is famous for its marvellous powers in
all Oriental fable), and sent him forth to wander about
the world. And he went through the villages and
cities, with a staff in his hand, weeping and lamenting,
and saying, 'I am Coheleth; I was beforetime Solomon,
and reigned over Israel in Jerusalem; but now I rule
over only this staff.'" It is a pretty and pathetic fable,
but it is a fable; and though it proves nothing else,
we may fairly infer from it that, even in the judgment
of the rabbis, the book Ecclesiastes must, on its own
showing, have been written after Solomon had ceased
to be King, <i>i.e.</i> after he had ceased to live.</p>

<p>In the Epilogue (xii. 9-12) the Author of the Book
lifts the dramatic mask from his face, and permits us
to see who he really is; a mask, let me add, somewhat
carelessly worn, since we see nothing of it in the last
ten chapters of the Book. Although he has written in
a feigned name, and, without asserting it, has so
moulded his phrases, at least in the earlier chapters
of his work, as to suggest to his readers that he is, if
not Solomon himself, at least Solomon's mouthpiece,
attributing the garnered results of his experience to
one greater than himself, that they may carry the
more weight&mdash;just as Browning speaks in the name
of Rabbi Ben Ezra, for instance, or Fra Lippo Lippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
or Abt Vogler, borrowing what he can of outward circumstance
from the age and class to which they belong,
and yet really uttering his own thought and emotion
through their lips&mdash;he now confesses that he is no
king of an age long past, but a rabbi, a sage, a teacher,
a master, who has both made some proverbs of his own
and collected the wise sayings of others who had gone
before him, in order that he might carry some little
light and comfort to the sorely bested men of his own
generation and blood.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In short, he has exercised his
right as a poet, or "maker," to embody the results of
his wide and varied experience of life in a dramatic
form, but is careful to let us know, before he takes
leave of us, that it is a fictitious or dramatic Solomon,
and not Solomon himself, to whom we have been
listening throughout.</p>

<p>So that all the phrases in the Book which are indicative
of its authorship confirm the inference drawn from its
style and its historical contents; viz. that it was not
written by Solomon, nor in his reign, but by an unknown
sage of a long-subsequent period, who, by a dramatic
impersonation of the characteristic experiences of the
son of David, or rather of his own experiences blended
with the Solomonic traditions and poured into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
moulds, sought to console and instruct his oppressed
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most convincing argument in favour
of this conclusion is that, when once we think of it, we
cannot possibly accept the Solomon set before us in
Ecclesiastes as the Solomon depicted in the historical
books of Scripture. Solomon the son of David, with
all his wisdom, played the fool. The foremost man
and Hebrew of his time, he gave his heart to "strange
women," and to gods whose ritual was not only
idolatrous, but cruel, dark, impure. In his pursuit
of science, unless the whole East belie him, he ran
into secret magical arts, incantations, divinations, an
occult intercourse with the powers of ill. In all ways
he departed from the God who had enriched him with
the choicest gifts, and sank, through luxury, extravagance,
and excess, first into a premature old age,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
then into a death so unrelieved by any sign of penitence,
or any promise of amendment, that from that
day to this rabbis and divines have discussed his final
doom, many of them leaning to the darker alternative.
This</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">"uxorious king, whose heart, though large,</span>
<span class="i0">Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell</span>
<span class="i0">To idols foul,"</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>is the Solomon of history. But the Solomon of
Ecclesiastes is a sage who represents himself as conducting
a series of moral experiments for the good of
mankind, in order that, with all the weight of manifold
experience, he may teach men what is that good and
right way which alone leads to peace. However hardly
we may think of the Wise King who was guilty of
so many follies, we can scarcely think of him as such
a fool that he did not know his sins to be sins, or as
such a knave that he deliberately endeavoured to palm
them off on other ages, not as transgressions of the
Divine Law, but as a series of delicate philosophic
experiments which he was good enough to conduct
for the benefit of the race.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, we conclude that in this Book
Solomon is taken as the Hebrew type of wisdom, the
wisdom which is based on large and varied experience;
and that this experience is here dramatized, in so far
as the writer could conceive it, for the instruction of
a race which from first to last, from the fable of
Jotham to the parables of our Lord, were accustomed
to receive instruction in fictitious and dramatic forms.
Its author was not Solomon, but one of "the wise"
whose name can no longer be recovered; it was written,
not in the time of Solomon, <i>i.e.</i> about 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, but
some five or six centuries later: and it was addressed
not to the wealthy and peaceful citizens whose king held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his court in Jerusalem, but to their degenerate and
enfeebled descendants during the period of the Persian
supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Doubtless many of the prevailing misapprehensions
of the meaning, authorship, and animating spirit of the
Book are due, in some measure, to the singular form
into which it is thrown. It belongs to what is known
as the Chokma, <i>i.e.</i> the Gnomic school, as opposed to
the Lyrical school of Hebrew poetry. The Jewish,
like Oriental literature in general, early assumed this
form, which seems to have a natural affinity with the
Eastern mind. Grave men, who made a study of life or
who devoted themselves to a life of study, were likely
to be sententious, to compress much thought into few
words, especially in the ages in which writing was a
somewhat rare accomplishment, or in which, as in the
Hebrew schools, instruction was given by a living
voice. No doubt they began with coining sage or
witty aphorisms, generally lit up with a happy metaphor,
each of which was complete in itself. Such sayings,
as memorable and portable, no less than as striking
for beauty and "matterful" for meditation, would
commend themselves to an age in which books were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
few and scarce. They are to be found in abundance
in the proverbs of all ancient races, and in the Book of
Proverbs which bears the name of Solomon, and many
of the more didactic and elaborate Psalms; while the
Book of Job preserves many of the sayings current
among the Arabs and the Egyptians. But with the
Hebrews this literary mode took what is, so far as I
am aware, a singular and unparalleled development, from
the time of Solomon onwards, rising to its highest
pitch in the Book of Job, and sinking to its lowest&mdash;within
the limits of the Canon at least&mdash;in the cramping
over-ingenuities of the acrostic Psalms, and in such
proverbs as those attributed to Agur the son of
Jakeh.</p>

<p>This development has not as yet, I think, attracted
the attention it deserves; at least I have nowhere met
with any formal recognition of it. Yet, undoubtedly,
while at first the Hebrew sages were content to
compress much wit or wisdom into the small compass
of a <i>gnome</i>, which they polished like a gem, leaving
each to shine by its own lustre and to make its own
unaided impression, there rose in process of time men
who saw new and great capacities in this ancient
literary form, and set themselves to string their gems
together, to arrange their own or other men's proverbs
so aptly and artistically that they enhanced each other's
beauty, while at the same time they compelled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to carry a logical and continuous stream of thought, to
paint an elaborate picture, to build up a lofty yet
breathing personification (that of Wisdom, for example,
in Proverbs viii.), to describe a lengthened and varied
ethical experience (as in Ecclesiastes), and even to
weave them into a large and sublime poem, like that of
Job, which has never been excelled. The reluctance
with which this form lends itself to the nobler functions
of literature, the immense difficulty of the instrument
which many of the Hebrew poets wielded, will become
apparent to any one who should try the experiment.
We have a goodly collection of proverbs, drawn from
many sources, foreign as well as native, in the English
tongue. Let any man endeavour so to set or arrange
them, or a selection from them, as to produce a
fine poem on a lofty theme, and he at least will not
underrate the difficulty of the task, even though we
should concede to him the right to <i>make</i> proverbs
where he could not find them to his mind. Yet to
many of the finest Hebrew poets the very restrictions
of this form seem to have possessed a charm such as
the far less rigid and encumbering laws of the sonnet,
or even of the triolet and other fanciful poetic wares of
modern times, have exerted on the minds of many of
our own poets.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A careful student of the Chokma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
school might even, I believe, trace the growth of this
art, from its small beginnings in the earlier gnomic
sayings of the Wise, to its culmination in the Book of
Job; and, in so doing, would confer a boon on all
students of Holy Writ.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is to this school that the Preacher belongs, as he
himself informs us in the Epilogue to his fine Poem.
He set himself, he says, "<i>to compose</i>, <i>to collect</i>, and <i>to
arrange many proverbs</i>" (xii. 9), rejecting any that were
not "words of truth," preferring, as was natural in a
time so dark, such as were "words of comfort" (xii. 10),
and seeking his sayings both from the sages who stood
by the old ways and those who looked for the new
(xii. 11). And, of course, the arranging of his awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and inelastic material was far more difficult than collecting
it&mdash;arranging it so as to compel it to tell his story,
and carry his argument to its lofty close. It is Story,
the sculptor and poet, I believe, who says that "the best
part of every work of art is unseen," unexpressed,
inexpressible in tones, or verse, or colours: it is that
invisible something which lends it dignity, spirit, life,
that "style" which, in this case, is in very deed the
man. And the best part of Coheleth's noble work is
this art of arranging his gnomic sayings in the best
order, the order in which they illuminate each other
most brightly and contribute most effectively to the
total impression. Hence, both in translating and in
endeavouring to interpret him, whenever I have had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
choose between rival renderings or meanings, I have
made it a rule to prefer that which most conduced to
the logical sequence of his work or carried the finer
sense, deeming that at least so much as this was due
to so great a master, and entertaining no fear that I
could invent any meaning which would outrun his
intention.</p>

<p>In fine, if I were to gather up into a few sentences
the impression which "much study" of this Scripture
has left on my mind as to the manner in which the
author worked upon it, I should say: that Coheleth, a
man of much of Solomon's original "largeness of heart"
and a great lover of wisdom, set himself to collect
the scattered sayings of the sages who were before
him. He took the traditional story of Solomon as the
ground and framework of his poem, at least at the
outset, though he seems to have soon laid it aside, and
endeavoured so to assort and arrange the proverbs he
had collected that each would lead up to the next; while
each group of them would describe some of the ways in
which men commonly pursued the chief good, ways in
most of which Solomon was at least reputed to have
travelled far. Finding gaps which could not be well
filled up from his large and various collection, he
bridged them over with proverbs of his own composing,
till he had got a sufficient account of each of the main
adventures of that Quest. And, then, he put adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
after adventure together in the order in which they best
led up to his great conclusion.</p>

<p>In all this I have said nothing, it is true, of that
"inspiration of the Almighty" which alone gives man
understanding of spiritual things. But why should
not "He who worketh all," and has deigned to use
every form of literary art by which men teach their
fellows, move and inspire a lover of wisdom to collect
and arrange the sayings of the Wise, if by these he
could carry truth and comfort to those who were in sore
need of both? And where, save from heaven and from
Him who rules in heaven, could Coheleth have learned
the great secret&mdash;the secret of a retributive life beyond
the grave? Even the best and wisest of the Hebrews
saw that life only "as through a glass, darkly;" and
even their fitful and imperfect conception of it seems
always to have been&mdash;as in the case of David, Job,
Isaiah&mdash;an immediate gift from God, and a gift so large
that even their hands of faith could hardly grasp it.
No one need doubt the inspiration of a Scripture which
affirms, not only that God is always with us, passing
a present and effective judgment on all we do, but also
that, when this life is over, He will bring every deed
and every secret thing into judgment, whether it be
good or whether it be bad. That was not an everyday
thought with the Jewish mind. We find it only in
men who were moved by the Holy Ghost to accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
teaching of his providence or the revelation of his
grace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As for the design of the Book, no one now doubts that
it sets before us the search for the <i>summum bonum</i>, the
quest of the Chief Good. Its main immediate intention
was to deliver the exiled Jews from the misleading
ethical theories and habits into which they had fallen,
from the sensualism and the scepticism occasioned by
their imperfect conception of the Divine ways, by showing
them that the true good of life is not to be secured by
philosophy, by the pursuit of pleasure, by devotion to
traffic or public affairs, by amassing wealth; but that it
results from a temperate and thankful enjoyment of the
gifts of the Divine bounty, and a cheerful endurance of
toil and calamity, combined with a sincere service
of God and a steadfast faith in that future life in which
all wrongs will be righted and all the problems which
now task and afflict us will receive a triumphant solution.
Availing himself of the historical and traditional records
of Solomon's life, he depicts, under that disguise, the
moral experiments which he has conducted; depicts
himself as having put the claims of wisdom, mirth,
business, wealth, to a searching test, and found them
incompetent to satisfy the cravings of the soul; as
attaining no rest nor peace until he had learned a simple
enjoyment of simple pleasures, a patient constancy under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
heavy trials, heartfelt devotion to the service of God,
and an unwavering faith in the life to come.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The contents of the Poem are, or may be, distributed
into a Prologue, Four Acts or Sections, and an Epilogue.</p>

<p>In the Prologue (chap. i., vv. 1-11), Coheleth states
the Problem to be solved.</p>

<p>In the First Section (chap. i., ver. 12&mdash;chap. ii., ver.
26), he depicts the endeavour to solve it by seeking the
Chief Good in Wisdom and in Pleasure.</p>

<p>In the Second Section (chap. iii., ver. 1&mdash;chap. v.,
ver. 20), the Quest is pursued in Traffic and Political
Life.</p>

<p>In the Third Section (chap. vi., ver. 1&mdash;chap. viii.,
ver. 15), the Quest is carried into Wealth and the
Golden Mean.</p>

<p>In the Fourth Section (chap. viii., ver. 16&mdash;chap. xii.,
ver. 7), the Quest is achieved, and the Chief Good
found to consist in a tranquil and cheerful enjoyment
of the present, combined with a cordial faith in the
future, life.</p>

<p>And in the Epilogue (chap. xii., vv. 8-14) he summarises
and emphatically repeats this solution of the
Problem.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was very natural that the Problem here discussed
should fill a large space in Hebrew thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
literature; that it should be the theme of many of the
Psalms and of many of the prophetic "burdens", as well
as of the Books Ecclesiastes and Job. For the Mosaic
revelation did teach that virtue and vice would meet
suitable rewards now, in this present time. At the
giving of the Law Jehovah announced that He would
show mercy to the thousands of those who kept his
commandments, and that He would visit the iniquities
of the disobedient upon them. The Law that came by
Moses is crowded with promises of temporal good to
the righteous, and with threatenings of temporal evil
to the unrighteous. The fulfilment of these threatenings
and promises is carefully marked in the Hebrew
chronicles; it is the supplication which breathes
through the recorded prayers of the Hebrew race, and
the theme of their noblest songs; it is their hope and
consolation under the heaviest calamities. What, then,
could be more bewildering to a godly and reflective
Jew than to discover that this fundamental article of
his faith was questionable, nay, that it was contradicted
by the commonest facts of human life as life grew
more complex and involved? When he saw the
righteous driven before the blasts of adversity like a
withered leaf, while the wicked lived out all their days
in mirth and affluence; when he saw the only nation
that attempted obedience to the Law groaning under
the miseries of a captivity embittered by the cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
caprices of rulers who could not even rule themselves,
and unrelieved by any hope of deliverance, while
heathen races revelled in the lusts of sense and power
unrebuked: when <i>this</i> seemed to be the rule of providence,
the <i>law</i> of the Divine administration, and not that
better rule revealed in his Scriptures, is it any wonder
that, forgetting all corrective and balancing facts, he
was racked with torments of perplexity; that, while
some of his fellows plunged into the base relief of
sensualism, he should be plagued with doubts and
fears, and search eagerly through all avenues of
thought for some solution of the mystery?</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, is this problem without interest for us;
for we as persistently misinterpret the New Testament
as the Hebrews did the Old. We read that "whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap;" we read
that "the meek shall inherit the earth;" we read that
for every act of service done to Christ we shall receive
"a hundredfold now, in this present time;" and we are
very prompt with the gross, careless interpretation
which makes such passages mean that if we are good
we shall have the good things of this life, while its evil
things shall be reserved for the evil. Indeed, we are
trained&mdash;or, perhaps I should say, until recently we
<i>were</i> trained&mdash;in this interpretation from our earliest
years. Our very spelling-books are full of it, and are
framed on the model of "Johnny was a good boy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he got plum-cake; but Tommy was a bad boy, and he
got the stick." Nearly all our story-books have a
similar moral: it is always, or almost always, the good
young man who gets the beautiful wife and large estate,
while the bad young man comes to a bad end. Our
proverbs are full of it, and axioms such as "Honesty
is the best policy," a pernicious half-truth, are for ever
on our lips. Our art, in so far as it is <i>ours</i>, is in
the same conspiracy. In Hogarth, for instance, as
Thackeray has pointed out, it is always Francis
Goodchild who comes to be Lord Mayor and poor Jem
Scapegrace who comes to the gallows. And when, as
life passes on, we discover that it is the bad boy who
often gets the plum-cake, and the good boy who goes to
the rod; that bad men often have beautiful wives and
large estates, while good men fail of both; when we
find the knave rising to place and authority, and honest
Goodchild in the workhouse or the <i>Gazette</i>, then there
rise up in our hearts the very doubts and perplexities
and eager painful questions which of old time troubled
the Psalmist and the Prophet. We cry out with Job&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"It is all one&mdash;therefore will I say it,</span>
<span class="i0">The guilty and the guiltless He treateth alike;</span>
<span class="i0">The deceiver and the deceived both are his;"</span>
</div>

<p>or we say with the Preacher,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"This is the greatest evil of all that is done under the sun</span>
<span class="i1">That there is one fate for all;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>The same fate befalleth to the righteous and to the wicked,</span>
<span class="i1">To the good and pure and to the impure,</span>
<span class="i0">To him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not:</span>
<span class="i1">As is the good so is the sinner,</span>
<span class="i0">And he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath."</span>
</div>

<p>And it is well for us if, like the Hebrew poet, we
can resist this cruel temptation, and hold fast the
integrity of our faith; if we can rest in the assurance
that, after all and when all is done, "the little that
a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
wicked;" that God has something better than wealth
and lucky haps for the good, and merciful correctives
of a more sovereign potency than penury and
mishaps for the wicked. If we have this faith, our
study of Ecclesiastes can hardly fail to deepen and
confirm it; if we are not so happy as to have it,
Coheleth will give us sound reasons for embracing it.</p>


<h2>§ 2. <i>ON THE HISTORY OF THE CAPTIVITY.</i></h2>

<p>If we may now assume the Book Ecclesiastes to
have been written, not in the time of Solomon, but
during, or soon after, the Babylonian Captivity, our
next duty is to learn what we can of the social, political,
and religious conditions of the two races among whom
the Jews were thrown when they were carried away
from the land of their fathers. That they learned
much, as well as suffered much, while they sat by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
waters of Babylon; that they emerged from their long
exile with a profound attachment to the Word of God,
such as their fathers had never known, and with many
precious additions to that Word, is beyond a doubt.
As plants grow fastest by night, so men make their
most rapid growth in knowledge and in faith when
times are dark and troubled. And all students of this
period are at one in affirming that during the Captivity
a radical and most happy change passed upon the
Hebrew mind. They came out of it with a hatred of
idolatry, a faith in the life beyond the grave, a pride in
their national Law, a hope in the advent of the great
Deliverer and Redeemer, with which the elder Psalmists
and Prophets had failed to inspire them, but which henceforth
they never wholly relinquished. With the religious
there was blended an intellectual advance. Books and
teachers were sought and honoured as never heretofore.
Schools and synagogues grew up in every town
and village in which they dwelt. "Of making of many
books there was no end." Education was compulsory.
Study was regarded as more meritorious than sacrifice,
a scholar as greater than a prophet, a teacher as greater
than a king, if at least we may trust proverbs which
were current among them. Before the Captivity one
of the least literate of nations&mdash;noble as their national
literature was, at its close the Jews were distinguished
by their zeal for culture and education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>To trace the progress of this marvellous revival of
letters and religion&mdash;a renaissance and a reformation
in one&mdash;would be a most welcome task, had we the
materials for it and the skill to use them. But even
the scanty materials that exist lie scattered through the
historical and literary remains of many different races&mdash;in
the cylinders, sculptures, paintings, inscriptions,
tombs, shrines of Nineveh, Babylon, Behistun, and
Persepolis, in the Zendavesta, in the pages of Herodotus
and the earlier Greek historians, in Josephus, in the
Apocrypha, in the Talmud, and in at least a dozen
of the Old Testament books; and some of these
"sources" are very far as yet from having been explored
and mastered. Hence the history of this period
still remains to be written, and will probably be largely
conjectural whenever, if ever, it is written. Yet what
period is of graver interest to the student of the Bible?
If we could recover its history, it would throw a new
and most welcome light on well-nigh one-half of the
Old Testament Scriptures, if not on all.</p>

<p>Happily, a brief sketch of it, such as is well within
any man's reach, will suffice to show how, from their
contact with the Babylonian and Persian races, the
Jews received literary and religious impulses which go
far to account for the marvellous changes which swept
over them, and enable us to read the Preacher intelligently,
and see how his social and political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
allusions exactly correspond with what we know of the
time.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>About a hundred and twenty years after the destruction
of the kingdom of Israel by Shalmaneser, King of
Assyria (<small>B.C.</small> 719), the kingdom of Judah fell before
Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon (<small>B.C.</small> 598-596).
The city, palace, and temple of Jerusalem were levelled
in a common ruin; the nobles, priests, merchants, and
skilled artisans, all the pith and manhood of Judah,
were carried away captive; only a few of the most
abject of the people were left to mourn and starve
amid the ravaged fields. Nothing could present a more
striking contrast to their native land than the region
to which the Jews were deported. Instead of a small
picturesque mountain-country, with its little cities set
on hills or on the brink of precipitous ravines, they
entered on a vast plain, fertile beyond all precedent
indeed, and abounding in streams, but with nothing
to break the monotony of level flats save the high
walls and lofty towers of one enormous city. For
Babylonia proper was simply an immense plain, lying
between the Arabian Desert and the Tigris, and of an
extent somewhat under that of Ireland. But though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of a limited area as compared with the vast empire
of which it was the centre, by its amazing fertility it
was capable of sustaining a crowded population. It
was watered not only by the great rivers Tigris and
Euphrates, but by their numerous affluents, many of
which were themselves considerable streams; it was "a
land of brooks and fountains." On this rich alluvial
plain, amply supplied with water, and under the fierce
heat of the sun, wheat and barley, with all kinds of
grain, yielded a return far beyond all modern parallel.
The capital city of this fertile province was the largest
and the most magnificent of the ancient world, standing
on both sides of the Euphrates, as London stands on
both sides of the Thames, and covering at least a hundred
square miles.</p>

<p>In this country and city (for "Babylon" stands for
both in the Bible), so unlike the sunny cliffs and
scattered villages of their native home, the Jews, who,
like all hill-races, cherished a passionate affection for
the land of their fathers, spent many bitter years.
On the broad featureless plain they pined for "the
mountains" of Judea (Ezekiel xxxvi.; Psalm cxxxvii.);
they sat down by the waters and wept as they remembered
"the hill of the Lord." They do not seem,
however, to have been handled with exceptional harshness
by their captors. They were treated as colonists
rather than as slaves. They were allowed to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
together in considerable numbers, and to observe
their own religious rites. They took the advice
of the prophet Jeremiah (xxix. 4-7), who had warned
them that their exile would extend over many years,
and built houses, planted gardens, married wives,
and brought up children; they "sought the peace of
the city" in which they were captives, "and prayed
for it," knowing that in its peace they would have
peace. If many of them had to labour gratuitously
on the great public works&mdash;and this labour was exacted
of most of the conquered races&mdash;many rose, by fidelity,
thrift, diligence, to places of trust, and amassed considerable
wealth. Among those who filled high posts
in the household or administration of the successive
monarchs of Babylon were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
and Azariah; Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Mordecai;
Tobit&mdash;if indeed Tobit be a real and not a
fictitious person&mdash;and his nephew Achiacharus.</p>

<p>But who were the people, and what were the social
and political conditions of the people, among whom
the Hebrew captives lived? The two leading races
with whom they were brought in contact were the
Babylonians&mdash;an offshoot from the ancient Chaldean
stock&mdash;and the Persians. The history of the Captivity
divides itself into two main periods, therefore, the
Persian and the Babylonian, at each of which we
must glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>1. <i>The Babylonian Period.</i>&mdash;For more than fifty
years after they were carried away captive, the Jews
served a Chaldean race, and were governed by Assyrian
despots, of whom Nebuchadnezzar<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was by far the
greatest whether in peace or war. It is hardly too
much to say that but for him the Babylonians would
have had no place in history. A great soldier, a great
statesman, a great builder and engineer, he knew how
to consolidate and adorn his vast empire, an empire
which is said to have "extended from the Atlantic to
the Caspian, and from Caucasus to the Great Sahara."
We owe our best conception of the personal character
and public life of this great despot to the Book of
Daniel. Daniel, although a Jew and a captive, was
the vizier of the Babylonian monarch, and retained
his post until the Persian conquest, when he became
the first of "the three presidents" of the new empire.
He therefore paints Nebuchadnezzar from the life.
And in his Book we see the great King at the head
of a magnificent court, surrounded by "princes,
governors, and captains, judges, treasurers, councillors,
and sheriffs," waited on by "well-favoured" eunuchs,
attended by a crowd of astrologers and "wise men"
who interpret to him the will of Heaven. He wields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
an absolute power, and disposes with a word of the
lives and fortunes of his subjects, even the highest
and most princely. All offices are in his gift. He
can raise a slave to the second place in his kingdom
(Daniel, to wit), and impose a foreigner (again, Daniel)
on the priestly college as its head. Of so enormous
a wealth that he makes an image of pure gold ninety
feet high and nine feet broad, he lavishes it on public
works&mdash;on temples, gardens, canals, fortifications&mdash;rather
than on personal indulgence. Religious after
a fashion, he wavers between "the God of the Jews"
and the deity after whom he was named and whom he
calls <i>his</i> god. In temper he is hasty and violent, but
not obstinate; he suddenly repents of his sudden
resolves; he is capable of bursts of gratitude and
devotion no less than of fierce accesses of fury, and
displays at times a piety and self-abasement astonishing
in an Oriental despot. His successors&mdash;Evil-Merodach,
Neriglissar, Laborosoarchod, Nabonadius, and Belshazzar&mdash;need
not detain us. Little is known of them, and,
with one exception, their reigns were very short; and
their main task seems to have been the erection of vast
and sumptuous structures such as Nebuchadnezzar had
been wont to rear. Probably none of the Babylonian
monarchs save Nebuchadnezzar made any deep impression
on the Hebrew mind.</p>

<p>And, indeed, the people of Babylon were much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
likely than their despots to influence the Hebrew
captives; for with them they would be brought into
daily contact. Now the Babylonians were marked by a
singular intellectual ability. Keen to know, patient to
observe, exact and laborious in their researches, they
could hardly fail to teach much to subject races, and
to inspire them with some desire for knowledge. They
had carried the sciences of mathematics and astronomy
to a high pitch of perfection. They are said to have
determined, within two seconds, the exact length of the
solar year, and not to have been far wrong in the
distances at which they computed the sun, moon and
planets from the earth; and they compiled a serviceable
catalogue of the fixed stars. The Hebrew prophets
often refer to their "wisdom and learning." They
excelled in architecture. Two of their vast works, the
walls of Babylon, and the hanging gardens, were
reckoned among "the seven wonders" of the ancient
world. Their skill in manufacturing and arranging
enamelled bricks has never yet been equalled.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In all
mechanical arts, indeed, such as cutting stones and
gems, casting gold and silver, blowing glass, modelling
vases and ware, weaving carpets and muslins and
linen, they take a very high place among the nations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
antiquity. With manufacturing and artistic skill they
combined the spirit of enterprise and adventure which
leads to commerce. They were addicted to maritime
pursuits; the "cry," or joy, "of the Chaldeans is in
their ships," says Isaiah (xliii. 14); and Ezekiel (xvii. 4)
calls Babylonia "a land of traffic," and its chief city
"a city of merchants."</p>

<p>But a larger, and probably the largest, class of the
people must have busied themselves with the toils of
agriculture; the broad Chaldean plain being famous,
from the time of the Patriarchs to the present day, for
an amazing and almost incredible fertility. Wheat,
barley, millet, and sesame, all flourished with astonishing
luxuriance, the ground commonly yielding a hundredfold,
two hundredfold, and even ampler rewards
for the toil of the husbandman.</p>

<p>With these abundant sources of wealth at their
command, the people naturally grew luxurious and
dissolute. "The daughter of the Chaldeans," says
Isaiah (xlvii. 1-8), "is tender and delicate," given to
pleasures, apt to live carelessly; her young men, says
Ezekiel (xxiii. 15), are dandies, "exceeding in dyed attire,"
painting their faces, and wearing earrings. Chastity,
in our modern sense of the term, was unknown.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>The pleasures of the table and of the couch were
carried to excess. Yet, like many other Eastern races,
the Babylonians hid under their soft luxurious exterior
a fierceness very formidable to their foes. The
Hebrew Prophets (Hab. i. 6-8; Isaiah xiv. 16) describe
them as "a bitter and hasty," a "terrible and
dreadful" people, "fiercer than the evening wolves,"
a people whose tramp "made the earth tremble, and
did shake kingdoms;" and all the historians of the
time charge them with a thirst for blood which often
took the most savage and inhuman forms.</p>

<p>Of the horrible licence and cruelty of the worship
of Bel, Merodach, and Nebo, which did much to foster
the fierce and cruel temper of the people, it is not
necessary, it is hardly possible, to speak. Roughly
taken, it was the service of the great forces of Nature
by a wanton indulgence of the worst passions of man.
It is enough to know that in Babylon idolatry took
forms which made all forms of idolatry henceforth
intolerable to the Jews; that now, once for all, they
renounced that worship of strange gods to which they
and their fathers had always hitherto been prone.
This of itself was an immense advance, a great gain.
Nor was it their only gain; for if by contact with the
idolatrous Babylonians the Jews were driven back on
their own Law and Scripture, their intercourse with
a people of so active an intellect and a learning so deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and wide led them to study the Word of Jehovah in
a new and more intelligent spirit.</p>

<p>Nor is it less obvious that in the social and political
conditions of the Babylonians we have a key to many
of the allusions to public life contained in Ecclesiastes.
The great empire, indeed, presents precisely those
elements which, in degenerate times and under feebler
despots, must inevitably develop into the disorder, and
misery, and crime which Coheleth depicts.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Persian Period.</i>&mdash;The conquest of Babylon
by the Persians, led by the heroic Cyrus, is, thanks to
Daniel, one of the most familiar incidents of ancient
history, so familiar that I need not recount it. By
this conquest Cyrus&mdash;"the Shepherd, the Messiah, of
the Lord," as Isaiah (xliv. 28; xlv. 1) terms him&mdash;became
the undisputed master of well-nigh the whole
known world of the time. Nor does he seem to have
been unworthy of his extraordinary position. Of all
ancient Oriental monarchs, out of the Hebrew pale, he
bears the highest repute. Even the Greek authors,
for the most part, represent him as energetic and
patient, magnanimous and modest, and of a religious
mind. Æschylus calls him "kindly" or "generous."
Xenophon selected him as a model prince for all races.
Plutarch says that "in wisdom, and virtue, and greatness
of soul he appears to have been in advance of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
kings." Diodorus makes one of his speakers say that
Cyrus gained his ascendency by his self-command and
good-feeling and gentleness. Simple in his habits,
brave, and of a most just, humane, and clement spirit,
he hated the cruel and lascivious idols of the East,
and worshipped one only God, "the God of heaven."
There is none like him in the antique world, none at
least among the kings and princes of that world. And
when, at the conquest of Babylon, he discovered in the
captive Jews a race that also hated idols, and served
one Lord, and knew a law of life as pure as his own,
or even purer, we need feel no surprise either that he
broke their bands in sunder and set them free to return
to their native land, or that they saw in this pure and
noble nature, this virtuous and religious prince, "a
servant of Jehovah," and even a partial and shadowy
resemblance to that Divine Deliverer and Redeemer
for whose advent they had been taught to look.</p>

<p>Cyrus was sixty years of age when he took Babylon
(<small>B.C.</small> 539), and died ten years after his conquest. He
was succeeded by men utterly unlike himself, so unlike
that the Persian nobles revolted from them, and placed
Darius Hystaspes, the heir of an ancient dynasty, on
the throne. As Cyrus was the soldier of the Persians,
so Darius was their statesman. He it was who founded
the "satrapial" form of administration; <i>i.e.</i> instead of
governing the various provinces of his empire through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
native princes, he placed Persian satraps over them,
these satraps being charged with the collection of
the public revenue, the maintenance of order, and the
administration of justice; in fact, he governed the
whole Eastern world very much as we govern India.
The internal organization of his vast unwieldy empire
was the great work of Darius through his long reign of
six-and-thirty years; but the event by which he is
best remembered, and which proved to be fruitful in
the most disastrous results to the State, was the
opening of that fatal war with Greece, which at last,
and under his feeble and degenerate successors, Xerxes,
Artaxerxes, and the rest, reached its close in the
downfall of the Persian empire. We need not linger
over the details of the story. It will be enough, for
our purpose, to say that from the accession of Xerxes
down to the conquest of the Persian empire by Alexander
the Great&mdash;a stretch of a hundred and fifty years&mdash;that
empire was declining to its fall. Its history
towards the end was a mere succession of intrigues and
insurrections, conspiracies and revolts. "Battle, murder,
and sudden death" are its staple. The restraints
of law and order grew ever weaker. The satraps were
practically supreme in their several provinces, and used
their power to extort enormous wealth from their
miserable subjects. Eunuchs and concubines ruled in
the palace. Manliness died out; the Persians were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
longer taught "to ride, to draw the bow, and to speak
the truth;" cunning and treachery took its place.
The scene grows more and more pitiful, till at last the
welcome darkness rushes down, and hides the ignoble
agony of perhaps the vastest and wealthiest empire the
world has seen.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But we must turn from the despots and their adventures
to form some slight acquaintance with the people,
the Persian people who, by the conquest of Cyrus, became
the ruling class in the empire, always remembering,
however, that the Babylonians must have remained
by myriads both in the capital and in the provinces,
and would continue to exert their influence on Hebrew
thought and activity.</p>

<p>In all moral and religious qualities the Persians were
far in advance of the Chaldeans, though they were
probably behind them in many civilized arts and crafts.
They were famous for their truthfulness and valour.
The Greeks<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> confessed the Persians to be their equals
in "boldness and warlike spirit"&mdash;Æschylus<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> calls
them "a valiant-minded people"&mdash;while they are
lavish in praise of the Persian veracity, a virtue in
which they themselves were notably deficient. To the
Persians God was "the Father of all truth;" to lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was shameful and irreligious. They disliked traffic
because of its haggling, equivocation, and dishonest
shifts. "Their chief faults," and even these were not
developed till they became masters of the world, "were
an addiction to self-indulgence and luxury, a passionate
<i>abandon</i> to the feeling of the hour whatever it might
be, and a tameness and subservience in all their relations
toward their princes which seem to moderns incompatible
with self-respect and manliness." Patriotism
came to mean mere loyalty to the monarch; the habit
of unquestioning submission to his will, and even to
his caprice, became a second nature to them. The
despotic humour natural in "a ruling person" was
thus nourished till it ran to the wildest excess. "He
was their lord and master, absolute disposer of their
lives, liberties, and property, the sole fountain of law
and right, incapable himself of doing wrong, irresponsible,
irresistible&mdash;a sort of God upon earth; one
whose favour was happiness, at whose frown men
trembled, before whom all bowed themselves down
with the lowest and humblest obeisance." No subject
could enter his presence save by special permission, or
without a prostration like that of worship. To come
unbidden was to be cut down by the royal guards,
unless, as a sign of grace, he extended his golden
sceptre to the culprit. To tread on the king's carpet
was a grave offence; to sit, even unwittingly, on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
seat a capital crime. So slavish was the submission
both of nobles and of people that we are required on
good authority to accredit such stories as these:
wretches bastinadoed by the king's order declared themselves
delighted that his majesty had condescended to
remember them; a father, whose innocent son was
shot by the despot in pure wantonness, had to crush
down his natural indignation and grief, and to compliment
the royal archer on the accuracy of his aim.</p>

<p>Despising trade and commerce as menial and degrading,
the ruling caste of a vast empire, with a monopoly
of office and boundless means of wealth at their command,
accustomed to lord it over subject races, of a
high spirit and a faith comparatively pure, their very
prosperity was their ruin, as it has been that of many
a great nation. In their earlier times, they were noted
for their sobriety and temperance. Content with simple
diet, their only drink was water from the pure mountain
streams; their garb was plain, their habits homely and
hardy. But their temperance soon gave place to an
immoderate luxury.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> They acquired the Babylonian
vices, and adopted at least the licence of the Babylonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
rites. They filled their harems with wives and concubines.
From the time of Xerxes onwards they grew
nice and curious of appetite, eager for pleasure, effeminate,
dissolute.</p>

<p>With the growth of luxury on the part of the nobles
and the people, the fear of the despot, at whose mercy
all their acquisitions stood, grew more intense, more
harassing, more degrading. Xerxes and his successors
were utterly reckless in their exercise of the absolute
power conceded to them, and delegated it to favourites
as reckless as themselves. No noble however eminent,
no servant of the State however faithful or distinguished,
could be sure that he might not at any moment incur a
displeasure which would strip him of all he possessed,
even if it did not also condemn him to a cruel and
lingering death. Out of mere sport and wantonness, to
relieve the tedium of a weary hour, the despot might
slay him with his own hand. For the crime, or assumed
crime, of one person a whole family, or class, or race
might be cut off unheard. Of the lengths to which this
cruelty and caprice might go we have a sufficient
example in the Book of Esther. The Ahasuerus of
that singular narrative was, there can hardly be any
doubt, the Xerxes of secular history&mdash;the very names,
unlike as they sound, are the same name differently
pronounced by two different races.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And all that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Book of Esther relates of the despot who repudiates
a wife because she will not expose herself to the
drunken admiration of a crowd of revellers, who raises
a servant to the highest honours one day and hangs him
the next, who commands the massacre of an entire race
and then bids them inflict a horrible carnage on those
who execute his decree, exactly accords with the Greek
narratives which depict him as scourging the sea for
having broken down his bridge over the Hellespont,
beheading the engineers whose work was swept away
by a storm, wantonly putting to death the sons of
Pythias, his oldest friend, before their father's eyes;
as first giving to his mistress the splendid robe presented
to him by his queen, and then giving up to the
queen's barbarous vengeance the mother of his mistress;
as shamefully misusing the body of the heroic Leonidas,
and, after his defeat by the Greeks, giving himself up
to a criminal voluptuousness and offering a reward to
the inventor of any new pleasure.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Book Ecclesiastes was written certainly not
before the reign of Xerxes (<small>B.C.</small> 486-465), and probably
many years after it, a period in which, bad as
were the conditions of his time, the times grew ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
more lawless, the despotism more intolerable, the
violence and licentiousness of the subordinate officials
more unblushing. But at whatever period within these
limits we may place it, all we have learned of the
Babylonians and the Persians during the later years of
the Captivity and the earlier years of the Exile (during
which the Jews were still under the Persian rule) is in
entire correspondence with the social and political state
depicted by the Preacher. The abler and more kindly
despots&mdash;as Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes&mdash;showed a singular
favour to the Jews. Cyrus published a decree
authorizing them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild
their temple, and enjoining the officials of the empire
to further them in their enterprise; Darius confirmed
that decree, despite the malignant misrepresentations
of the Samaritan colonists; Artaxerxes held Ezra and
Nehemiah in high esteem, and sent them to restore
order and prosperity to the city of their fathers and its
inhabitants. But a large number, apparently even a large
majority, of the Jews, unable or disinclined to return,
remained in the various provinces of the great empire,
and were of course subject to the violence and injustice
from which the Persians themselves were not exempt.
"Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity!"
cries the Preacher till we grow weary of the mournful
refrain. Might he not well take that tone in a time so
out of joint, so lowering, so dark?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>The Book is full of allusions to the Persian luxury,
to the Persian forms of administration, above all,
to the corruptions of the later years of the Persian
empire, and the miseries they bred. Coheleth's
elaborate description (ii. 4-8) of the infinite variety
of means by which he sought to allure his heart
unto mirth&mdash;his palaces, vineyards, paradises, with
their reservoirs and fountains, crowds of attendants,
treasures of gold and silver, the harem full of beauties
of all races&mdash;seems taken direct from the ample state
of some luxurious Persian grandee. His picture of
the public administration (v. 8, 9), in which "superior
watcheth over superior, and superiors again watch
over them," is a graphic sketch of the satrapial system,
with its official hierarchy rising grade above grade,
which was the work of Darius.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> When the animating
and controlling spirit of that system was taken away,
when weak foolish despots sat on the throne, and
despots just as foolish and weak ruled in every
provincial divan, there ensued precisely that political
state to which Coheleth perpetually refers.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Iniquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sat in the place of judgment, and in the place of equity
there was iniquity (iii. 16); kings grew childish, and
princes spent their days in revelry (x. 16); fools
were lifted to high place, while nobles were degraded;
and slaves rode on horses, while their quondam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
masters tramped through the mire (x. 6, 7). There
was no fair reward for faithful service (ix. 11). Death
brooded in the air, and might fall suddenly and unforeseen
on any head, however high (ix. 12). To
correct a public abuse was like pulling down a wall:
some of the stones were sure to fall on the reformer's
feet, from some cranny a serpent was sure to start
out and bite him (x. 8, 9). To breathe a word against
a ruler, even in the strictest privacy, was to run the
hazard of destruction (x. 20). A resentful gesture,
much more a rebellious word, in the divan was enough
to ensure outrage. In short, the whole political fabric
was fast falling into disrepair and decay, the rain
leaking through the rotting roof, while the miserable
people were ground down with ruinous exactions, in
order that their rulers might revel on undisturbed
(x. 18, 19). It is under such a pernicious and
ominous maladministration of public affairs, and the
appalling miseries it breeds, that there springs up in
the hearts of men that fatalistic and hopeless temper
to which Coheleth gives frequent expression. Better
never to have been born than to live a life so cramped
and thwarted, so full of perils and fears! Better
to snatch at every pleasure, however poor and brief,
than seek, by self-denial, by virtue, by integrity, to
accumulate a store which the first petty tyrant who
gets wind of it will sweep off, or a reputation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
wisdom and goodness which will be no protection
from, which will be only too likely to provoke, the
despotic humours of men "dressed in a little brief
authority."</p>

<p>If even Shakespeare,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in an unrestful and despairing
mood strangely foreign to his serene temperament,
beheld</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>if, "tired with all these," he cried for "restful death,"
we can hardly wonder that the Preacher, who had
fallen on times so evil that, compared with his, Shakespeare's
were good, should prefer death to life.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But there is another side to this sad story of the
Captivity, another and a nobler side. If the Jews
suffered much from Persian misrule, they learned much
and gained much from the Persian faith. In its earlier
form the religious creed whose documents Zoroaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
afterwards collected and enlarged in the Zendavesta
was probably the purest of the ancient heathen world;
and even when it was corrupted by the baser additions
of later times, its purer form was still preserved in
songs (Gâthâs) and traditions. There can be no
reasonable doubt that it largely affected the subsequent
faith of the Hebrews, not indeed teaching them any
truth they had not been taught before, but constraining
them to recognize truths in their Scriptures which
hitherto they had passed over or neglected.</p>

<p>In its inception the Persian creed and practice were
a revolt against the sensuous and sensual worship of
the great forces of Nature into which most Eastern
religions, often pure enough, in their primitive forms,
had degenerated, and, in especial, from the base forms
into which the Hindus had degraded that primitive faith
which is still to be recovered from the Rig-Veda. It
acknowledged persons, real spiritual intelligences, in
place of mere natural powers; and it drew moral distinctions
between them, dividing these ruling intelligences
into good and bad, pure and impure, benignant and
malevolent,&mdash;an immense advance on the mere admiration
of whatever was strong. Nay, in some sense, the
Persian faith affirmed monotheism against polytheism;
for it asserted that one Great Intelligence ruled over
all other intelligences, and through them over the
universe. This Supreme Intelligence, which the Persians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
called Ahura-mazda (Ormazd), is the true Creator,
Preserver, Governor, of all spirits, all men, all worlds.
He is "good," "holy," "pure," "true," "the Father
of all truth," "the best Being of all," "the Master of
Purity," "the Source and Fountain of all good." On
the righteous He bestows "the good mind" and
everlasting happiness; while He punishes and afflicts
the evil. His worshippers were to the last degree
intolerant of idolatry. They suffered no image to
profane their temples; their earliest symbol of Deity
is almost as pure and abstract as a mathematical sign,
a circle with wings; the circle to denote the eternity
of God, and the wings his omnipresence. Under this
Supreme Lord, "the God of heaven," they admitted
inferior beings, angels and archangels, whose names
mark them out as personified Divine attributes, or as
faithful servants who administer some province of the
Divine empire.</p>

<p>To win the favour of the God of heaven it was
requisite to cultivate the virtues of purity, truthfulness,
industry, and a pious sense of the Divine presence;
and these virtues must spring from the heart, and
cover thought as well as word and deed. His worship
consisted in the frequent offering of prayer, praise,
and thanksgiving; in the reiteration of certain sacred
hymns; in the occasional sacrifice of animals which,
after being presented before Ormazd, furnished forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a feast for priest and worshipper; and in the performance
of a mystic ceremony (the <i>Soma</i>), the gist of
which seems to have lain in a grateful acknowledgment
that the fruits of the earth, typified by the intoxicating
juice of the Homa plant, were to be received as the
gift of Heaven. A sentence or two from one of the
hymns<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of which there are many in the Zendavesta,
will show better than many words to how high a pitch
Divine worship was carried by the Persians: "We
worship Thee, Ahura-mazda, the pure, the master of
purity. We praise all good thoughts, all good words,
all good deeds which are or shall be; and we likewise
keep clean and pure all that is good. O Ahura-mazda,
thou true happy Being! We strive to think, to speak,
and to do only such things as may be best fitted to
promote the two lives" (<i>i.e.</i> the life of the body and the
life of the soul).</p>

<p>In this course of well-doing the faithful were animated
and confirmed by a devout belief in the immortality
of the soul and a conscious future existence. They
were taught that at death the souls of men, both good
and bad, travelled along an appointed path to a narrow
bridge which led to Paradise; over this bridge only
pious souls could pass, the wicked falling from it into
an awful gulf in which they received the due reward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
their deeds. The happy souls of the good were helped
across the long narrow arch by an angel,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and as they
entered Paradise a great archangel rose from his throne
to greet each of them with the words, "How happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
art thou, who hast come to us from mortality to
immortality!"</p>

<p>This wonderfully pure creed was, however, in process
of time, corrupted in many ways. First of all, "the sad
antithesis of human life," the conflict between light and
darkness, good and evil&mdash;the standing puzzle of the
world&mdash;led the votaries of Ormazd to <i>dualism</i>. Ormazd
loved and created only the good. The evil in man, and
in the world, must be the work of an enemy. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
enemy, Ahriman (Augrô-maniyus), has been seeking
from eternity to undo, to mar and blast, the fair work
of the God of heaven. He is the baleful author of all
evil, and under him are spirits as malignant as himself.
Between these good and evil powers there is incessant
conflict, which extends to every soul and every world.
It will never cease until the great Deliverer arise&mdash;for
even of <i>Him</i> the Persians had some dim prevision&mdash;who
shall conquer and destroy evil at its source, all
things then rounding to their final goal of good.</p>

<p>Another corrupting influence had its origin in a too
literal interpretation of the names given to the Divine
Being, or the qualities ascribed to Him, by the founders
of the faith. Ormazd, for example, had been described
as "true, <i>lucid</i>, <i>shining</i>, the originator of all the best
things, of the spirit in nature and of the growth in
nature, <i>of the luminaries and of the self-shining brightness
which is in the luminaries</i>." From these epithets and
ascriptions there sprang in later days the worship of
the sun, then of fire, as a type of God&mdash;a worship still
maintained by the disciples of Zoroaster, the Ghebers
and the Parsees. And from this point onward the old
sad story repeats itself; once more we have to trace
a pure and lofty primitive faith along the grades through
which it declines to the low, base level of a sensuous
idolatry. The Magians, always the bitter enemies of
Zoroastrianism, held that the four elements&mdash;fire, air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
earth, and water&mdash;were the only proper objects of
human reverence. It was not difficult for them to persuade
those who already worshipped fire, and were
beginning to forget of Whom fire was the symbol, to
include in their homage air, water, and earth. Divination,
incantations, the interpretation of dreams and
omens soon followed, with all the dark shadows which
science and religion cast behind them. And then came
the lowest deep of all, that worship of the gods by
sensual indulgence to which idolatry gravitates, as by
a law.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must remember that, even at their
worst, the Persians preserved the sacred records of
their earlier faith, and that their best men steadily
refused to accept the base additions to it which the
Magians proposed. Corrupt as in many respects many
of them became, the conquest of Babylon was the
death-blow to the sensual idol-worship which had
reigned for twenty centuries on the Chaldean plain; it
never wholly recovered from it, though it survived
it for a time. From that date it declined to its
fall: "Bel bowed down; Nebo stooped; Merodach
was broken in pieces" (Isa. xlvi. 1; Jer. l. 2). The
nobler monarchs of Persia were true disciples of the
primitive creed of their race. It was similarity of creed
which won their favour for the Hebrew captives. In
the decree which enfranchised them (Ezra i. 2, 3)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Cyrus expressly identifies Ormazd, "the God of
heaven," with Jehovah, the God of Israel; he says,
"<i>The Lord God of heaven</i> hath given me all the
kingdoms of the earth, and He hath charged me to
build <i>Him</i> a house at Jerusalem." Nor was this belief
in one God, whose temple was to be defiled by no image
even of Himself, the only point in common between the
better Persians, such as Cyrus and Darius, and the
better Jews. There were many such points. Both
believed in an evil spirit tempting and accusing men;
in myriads of angels, all the host of heaven, who formed
the armies of God and did his pleasure; in a tree of
life and a tree of knowledge, and a serpent the enemy
of man; both shared the hope of a coming Deliverer
from evil, the belief in an immortal and retributive life
beyond the grave, and a happy Paradise in which all
righteous souls would find a home and see their Father's
face. These common faiths and hopes would all be
points of sympathy and attachment between the two
races; and it is to this agreement in religious doctrine
and practice that we must ascribe the striking facts
that the Persians, ordinarily the most intolerant of men,
never persecuted the Jews; and that the Jews, ordinarily
so impatient of foreign domination, never made a single
attempt to cast off the Persian yoke, but stood by the
declining empire even when the Greeks were thundering
at its gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>On one question all competent historians and commentators
are agreed; viz. that the Jews gained
immensely in the clearness and compass of their
religious faith during the Captivity. That, which was
the punishment, was also the term, of their idolatry;
into that sin they never afterwards fell. Now first,
too, they began to understand that the bond of their
unity was not local, not national even, but spiritual and
religious; they were spread over every province of a
foreign empire, yet they were one people, and a sacred
people, in virtue of their common service of Jehovah
and their common hope of Messiah's advent. This
hope had been vaguely felt before, and just previous to
the Captivity Isaiah had arrayed it in an unrivalled
splendour of imagery; now it sank into the popular
mind, which needed it so sorely, and became a deep
and ardent longing of the national heart. From this
period, moreover, the immortality of the soul and
the life beyond death entered distinctly and
prominently into the Hebrew creed. Always latent in
their Scriptures, these truths disclosed themselves to
the Jews as they came into contact with the Persian
doctrines of judgment and future rewards. Hitherto
they had thought mainly, if not exclusively, of the
temporal rewards and punishments by which the Mosaic
law enforced its precepts. Henceforth they saw that,
in time and on earth, human actions are not carried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
their final and due results; they looked forward to a
judgment in which all wrongs should be righted, all
unpunished sins receive their recompense, and all the
sufferings of the good be transmuted into joy and
peace.</p>

<p>Now this, as we shall see, is the very moral of the
Book Ecclesiastes, the triumphant climax to which it
mounts. The endeavour of Coheleth is to show how
evil and good were blended in the human lot, evil so
largely preponderating in the lot of many of the good
as to make life a curse unless it were sustained by hope;
to give hope by assuring the Hebrew captives that
"God takes cognizance of all things," and "will bring
every work to judgment," good or bad; and to urge
on them, as the conclusion of his Quest, and as the
whole duty of man, to prepare for that supreme audit
by fearing God and keeping his commandments. This
was the light he was commissioned to carry into their
great darkness; and if the lamp and the oil were of God,
it is hardly too much to say that the spark which kindled
the lamp was taken from the Persian fire, since that too
was of God. Or, to vary the figure, and make it more
accurate, we may say that the truths of the future life
lay hidden in the Hebrew Scriptures, and that it was
by the light of the Persian doctrine of the future that
the Jews, stimulated by the mental culture and activity
acquired in Babylon, discovered them in the Word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>It is thus, indeed, that God has taught men in all
ages. The Word remains ever the same, but our
conditions change, our mental posture varies, and with
our posture the angle at which the light of Heaven falls
on the sacred page. We are brought into contact with
new races, new ideas, new forms of culture, new discoveries
of science, and the familiar Word forthwith
teems with new meanings, with new adaptations to our
needs; truths unseen before, though they were always
there, come to view, deep truths rise to the surface,
mysterious truths grow simple and plain, truths that
jangled on the ear melt into harmony; our new needs
stretch out lame hands of faith, and find an unexpected
but ample supply; and we are rapt in wonder and
admiration as we afresh discover the Bible to be the
Book for all races and for all ages, an inexhaustible
fountain of truth and comfort and grace.</p>

<h3><i>THE QUEST OF THE CHIEF GOOD IN WISDOM
AND IN PLEASURE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>, v. 12, to <span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>, v. 26.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
Wisdom.</i>
Ch. i., vv. 12-18.</div>

<p>
12 I, the Preacher, was King over Israel, in Jerusalem:<br />
<br />
13 And I applied my heart to survey and search by wisdom<br />
Into all that is done under heaven:<br />
This sore task hath God given to the children of men,<br />
To exercise themselves therewith.<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 13.</span> <i>To survey and search into, etc.</i> The verbs indicate
the broad extent which his researches covered, and the depth to
which they penetrated.</p></blockquote>

<p>
14 I have considered all the works that are done under the sun,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>And, behold, they are all vanity and vexation of spirit.<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 14.</span> <i>Vexation of spirit.</i> Literally, "striving after the
wind." But the time-honoured phrase, "vexation of spirit,"
sufficiently expresses the writer's meaning; and it seems
better to retain it than, with the Revised Version, to introduce
the Hebrew metaphor, which has a somewhat novel and foreign
sound.</p></blockquote>

<p>
15 That which is crooked cannot be set straight,<br />
And that which is lacking cannot be made up.<br />
<br />
16 Therefore I spake to my heart, saying,<br />
Lo, I have acquired greater wisdom<br />
Than all who were before me in Jerusalem,<br />
My heart having seen much wisdom and knowledge;<br />
<br />
17 For I had given my heart to find knowledge and wisdom.<br />
I perceive that even this is vexation of spirit;<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 17.</span> <i>To find knowledge and wisdom.</i> Both the Authorized
and Revised Versions render "to know wisdom, and to
know <i>madness and folly</i>." The latter clause, however, violates
both the sense and the grammatical construction. The word
translated "to know" is not an infinitive, but a noun, and should
be rendered "knowledge;" the word translated "folly" means
"prudence," and the word translated "madness" hardly means
more than "folly." The text, too, seems corrupt. The sense of
the passage is against it, I think, as it now stands; for the design
of the Preacher is simply to show the insufficiency of wisdom
and knowledge, not to prove folly foolish. On the whole, therefore,
it seems better to follow the high authority which arranges
the text as it is here rendered. The Hebraist will find the
question fully discussed in <i>Ginsburg</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
18 For in much wisdom is much sadness,<br />
And to multiply knowledge is to multiply sorrow.<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in Pleasure.</i>
Ch ii., vv. 1-11.</div>

<p>
1 Then I said to my heart,<br />
Go to, now let me prove thee with mirth,<br />
And thou shalt see pleasure:<br />
And, lo, this too is vanity!<br />
<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
2 To mirth I said, Thou art mad!<br />
And to pleasure, What canst thou do?<br />
<br />
3 I thought in my heart to cheer my body with pleasure,<br />
While my spirit guided it wisely,<br />
And to lay hold on folly,<br />
Till I should see what it is good for the sons of men to do under heaven,<br />
Through the brief day of their life.<br />
<br />
4 I gave myself to great works;<br />
I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;<br />
<br />
5 I made me gardens and parks,<br />
And I planted in them all manner of fruit-trees;<br />
<br />
6 I made me tanks of water,<br />
From which to water the groves:<br />
<br />
7 I bought me men-servants and maid-servants,<br />
And had servants born in my house.<br />
I had also many herds of oxen and sheep,<br />
More than all who were before me in Jerusalem:<br />
<br />
8 I heaped up silver and gold,<br />
And the treasures of kings and of kingdoms:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>I got me men-singers and women-singers;<br />
And took delight in many fair concubines:<br />
<br />
9 So that I surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem,<br />
My wisdom abiding with me;<br />
<br />
10 And nothing that my eyes desired did I withhold from them,<br />
I did not keep back my heart from any pleasure;<br />
For my heart took joy in all my toil,<br />
And this was my portion therefrom.<br />
<br />
11 But when I turned to look on all the works which my hands had wrought,<br />
And at the labour which it cost me to accomplish them,<br />
Behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit,<br />
And there was no profit under the sun.<br />
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wisdom and
Pleasure
compared.</i>
Ch. ii., vv. 12-23.</div>

<p>
12 Then I turned to compare wisdom with madness and folly&mdash;<br />
And what can he do that cometh after the king<br />
Whom they made king long ago?&mdash;<br />
<br />
13 And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly<br />
As far as light excelleth darkness:<br />
<br />
14 The wise man's eyes are in his head,<br />
While the fool walketh blindly.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Nevertheless I knew that the same fate will befall both.<br />
<br />
15 Therefore I spake with my heart:<br />
"A fate like that of the fool will befall me, even me;<br />
To what end, then, am I wiser?"<br />
And I said to my heart:<br />
"This too is vanity,<br />
<br />
16 For there is no more remembrance of the wise man than of the fool;<br />
For both will be forgotten,<br />
As in time past so also in days to come:<br />
And, alas, the wise man dieth even as the fool!"<br />
<br />
17 So life became hateful to me, for a sore burden was upon me,<br />
Even the labour which I wrought under the sun;<br />
Since all is vanity and vexation of spirit:<br />
<br />
18 Yea, I hated all the gain which I had gained under the sun,<br />
Because I must leave it to the man who shall come after me,<br />
<br />
19 And who can tell whether he will be a wise man or a fool?<br />
Yet shall he have power over all my gain<br />
Which I have wisely gained under the sun:<br />
This too is vanity.<br />
<br />
20 Then I turned and gave my heart up to despair<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>Concerning all the gain which I had gained under the sun;<br />
<br />
21 For here is a man who hath laboured wisely, and prudently, and dexterously,<br />
And he must leave it as a portion to one who hath not laboured therein:<br />
This also is vanity and a great evil;<br />
<br />
22 For man hath nothing of all his heavy labour,<br />
And the vexation of his heart under the sun,<br />
<br />
23 Since his task grieveth and vexeth him all his days,<br />
And even at night his heart hath no rest:<br />
This too is vanity.<br />

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Conclusion.</i>
Ch. ii., vv. 24-26.</div>

<p>
24 There is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink,<br />
And to let his soul take pleasure in his labour.<br />
But even this, I saw, cometh from God;<br />
<br />
25 For who can eat,<br />
And who enjoy himself, apart from Him?<br />
<br />
26 For to the man who is good before Him,<br />
He giveth wisdom and knowledge and joy;<br />
But to the sinner He giveth the task to gather and to heap up,<br />
That he may leave it to him who is good before God:<br />
This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.<br />

<p>
1 There is a time for all things,<br />

<br />
2 A time to be born, and a time to die;<br />

It is a gift of God.<br />

<p>
16 Moreover, I saw under the sun<br />
That there was iniquity in the place of justice,<br />
And in the place of equity there was iniquity.<br />
<br />
17 I said to mine heart:<br />
"God will judge the righteous and the wicked,<br />
For there is a time for everything and for every deed with Him."<br />
<br />
18 Yet I said to my heart of the children of men:<br />
"God hath sifted them,<br />
To show that they, even they, are but as beasts.<br />
<br />
19 For a mere chance is man, and the beast a mere chance,<br />
And they are both subject to the same chance;<br />
As is the death of the one, so is the death of the other;<br />
And both have the same spirit:<br />
And the man hath no advantage over the beast,<br />
For both are vanity:<br />
<br />
20 Both go to the same place;<br />
Both sprang from dust, and both turn into dust:<br />
<br />
21 And who knoweth whether the spirit of man goeth upward,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Or the spirit of the beast goeth downward to the earth?"<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 21.</span> The question is here, as so often in Hebrew, the
strongest form of negative. As in ver. 19 the Preacher affirms
of man and beast that "both have the same spirit," and, in
ver. 20, that "both go to the same place," so, in this verse, he
emphatically denies that there is any difference in their
destination at death.</p></blockquote>

<p>
22 Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better for man<br />
Than to rejoice in his labours;<br />

And who shall give him to see what will be after him?<br />

1 Then I turned to consider once more<br />
All the oppressions that are done under the sun:<br />
I beheld the tears of the oppressed,<br />
And they had no comforter;<br />
And their oppressors were violent,<br />
Yet had they no comforter:<br />
<br />
2 And I accounted the dead who died long ago<br />
Happier than the living who are still alive;<br />

3 While happier than either is he who hath not been born,<br />
Who hath not seen the evil which is done under the sun.

1 A good name is better than good nard,<br />
And the day of death better than the day of one's birth:<br />

2 It is better to go to the house of mourning<br />

<p>
3 Better is serious thought than wanton mirth,<br />

stubble makes the pot bubble."</p></blockquote>

7 Wrong-doing maketh the wise man mad,<br />
As a bribe corrupteth the heart.<br />

8 The end of a reproof is better than its beginning,<br />

10 Say not, "How is it that former days were better than these?"<br />

11 Wisdom is as good as wealth,<br />

a busy active life, are much occupied with traffic or public affairs.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 17.</span>: To illustrate this verse Dean Plumptre happily
quotes Hooker's noble and familiar words: "Dangerous it
were for the feeble brain of man to wade far into the doings
of the Most High; whom although to know be life, and joy to
make mention of His name, yet our soundest knowledge is to
know that we know Him not as indeed He is, neither can know
Him, and our safest eloquence concerning Him is our silence,
when we confess without confession that His glory is inexplicable,
his greatness above our capacity and reach."</p></blockquote>

1 For all this have I taken to heart and explored,<br />
That the righteous, and the wise, and their labours are in the hand of God:<br />
They know not whether they shall meet love or hatred;<br />
All lies before them.<br />
All are treated alike;<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 1.</span>: <i>They know not whether they shall meet love or hatred</i>
may mean that even the wisest cannot tell whether they shall
meet (1) the love or the enmity of God, as shown in adverse or
favourable providences; or (2) the things which they love or hate;
or (3) the love or the hatred of their fellows. The last of the
three seems the most likely.</p>

<p><i>All lies before them; i.e.</i> all possible chances, changes, events.
Only God can determine or foresee what is coming to meet them.</p></blockquote>

<p>
2 The same fate befalleth to the righteous and to the wicked,<br />
To the good and pure and to the impure,<br />
To him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not;<br />
As with the good so is it with the sinner,<br />
With him that sweareth as with him who feareth an oath.<br />

Yet, after it, they go to the dead;<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Ver. 3.</span>: The words of this verse do not, as they stand, seem
to carry on the logical sequence of thought. The Preacher's
complaint is that even the wise and the good are not exempted
from the common fate, not that the foolish and reckless are
exposed to it. The text may be corrupt; but Ginsburg is
content with it. A good reading of it, however, is still
wanting.</p></blockquote>

repair the mischief which such precipitate folly occasions." I

8 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher,<br />
All is vanity!<br />

Ginsburg conjectures, not without reason, as I think, that the
Sacred Name was omitted from this clause of the verse simply
because the Author wished to reserve it for the more emphatic
clause which follows it. Many good scholars, however, read the
clause as meaning simply, "The conclusion of the matter, <i>when
all has been heard," i.e.</i> which even the Sages can adduce.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE PROLOGUE.</h2>

<h3><i>IN WHICH THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK IS
INDIRECTLY STATED.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chap. I., vv. 1-11.</span></p>


<p>The search for the <i>summum bonum</i>, the quest of
the Chief Good, is the theme of the Book
Ecclesiastes. Naturally we look to find this theme,
problem, this "riddle of the painful earth," distinctly
stated in the opening verses of the Book. It is
stated, but not distinctly. For the Book is an autobiographical
poem, the journal of the Preacher's inward
life set forth in a dramatic form. "A man of ripe
wisdom and mature experience, he takes us into his
confidence. He unclasps the secret volume, and invites
us to read it with him. He lays before us what he has
been, what he has thought and done, what he has seen
and felt and suffered; and then he asks us to listen
to the judgment which he has deliberately formed on a
review of the whole."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But that he may the more
reservedly lay bare his heart to us, he uses the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Poet's privilege, and presents himself to us under a
mask and wrapped in Solomon's ample mantle. And
a dramatic poet conveys his conceptions of human
character and circumstance and action, not by direct
picturesque descriptions, but, placing men before us
"in their habit as they lived," he makes them speak
to us, and leaves us to infer their character and
condition from their words.</p>

<p>In accordance with the rules of his art, the dramatic
Preacher brings himself on the stage of his poem, permits
us to hear his most penetrating and characteristic
utterances, confesses his own most secret and inward
experiences, and thus enables us to conceive and to
judge him. He is true to his artistic canons from the
outset. His prologue, unlike that of the Book of Job,
is cast in the dramatic form. Instead of giving us a
clear statement of the moral problem he is about to
discuss, he opens with the characteristic utterances of
the man who, wearied with many futile endeavours,
gathers up his remaining strength to recount the
experiments he has tried and the conclusion he has
reached. Like Browning, one of the most dramatic
of modern poets, he plunges abruptly into his theme,
and speaks to us from the first through "feigned lips."
Just as in reading the <i>Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister</i>,
or the <i>Epistle of Karshish, the Arab Physician</i>, or a
score other of Browning's Poems, we have first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
glance through it in order to collect the scattered hints
which indicate the speaker and the time, and then
laboriously to think ourselves back, by their help, into
the time and conditions of the speaker, so also with
this Hebrew poem. It opens abruptly with "words
of the Preacher," who is at once the author and the
hero of the drama. "Who is he," we ask, "and
what?" "When did he live, and what place did he
fill?" And at present we can only reply, He is the
voice of one crying in the wilderness of Oriental
antiquity, and saying, "Vanity of vanities! <i>all</i> is
vanity!"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> For what intent, then, does his voice break
the long silence? Of what ethical mood is this pathetic
note the expression? What prompts his despairing cry?</p>

<p>It is the old contrast&mdash;old as literature, old as man&mdash;between
the ordered steadfastness of nature and
the disorder and brevity of human life. The Preacher
gazes on the universe above and around him. The
ancient earth is firm and strong beneath his feet. The
sun runs his race with joy, sinks exhausted into its
ocean bed, but rises on the morrow, like a giant
refreshed with old wine, to renew its course. The
variable and inconstant wind, which bloweth where it
listeth, blows from the same quarters, runs through
the very circuit which was its haunt in the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
world's grey fathers. The streams which ebb and
flow, which go and come, run along time-worn beds
and are fed from their ancient source. But man,
"to one point constant never," shifts from change
to change. As compared with the calm uniformity
of nature, his life is a mere phantasy, passing for
ever through a tedious and limited range of forms,
each of which is as unsubstantial as the fabric of
a vision, many of which are as base and sordid as
they are unreal, and all of which, for ever in a flux,
elude the grasp of those who pursue them, or disappoint
those who hold them in their hands. "All
is vanity; for man has no profit," no adequate and
enduring reward, "for all his labour;" literally,
"no balance, no surplus, on the balance-sheet of
life:" less happy, because less stable, than the earth
on which he dwells, he comes and goes, while the
earth goes on for ever (vv. 2-4).</p>

<p>This painful contrast between the ordered stability
of nature and the changeful and profitless disorder
of human life is emphasized by a detailed reference
to the large natural forces which rule the world, and
which abide unchanged, although to us they seem
the very types of change. The figure of ver. 5 is,
of course, that of the racer. The sun rises every
morning to run its course, pursues it through the day,
"pants," as one well-nigh breathless, toward its goal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and sinks at night into its subterraneous bed in the
sea; but, though exhausted and breathless at night,
it rises on the morrow refreshed, and eager, like a
strong, swift man, to renew its daily race. In ver. 6
the wind is represented as having a regular law and
circuit, though it now blows South, and now veers
round to the North. The East and West are not
mentioned, probably because they are tacitly referred
to in the rising and setting sun of the previous verse:
all the four quarters are included between the two.
In ver. 7 the streams are described as returning on
their sources; but there is no allusion here, as we
might suppose, to the tides,&mdash;and indeed tidal rivers
are comparatively rare,&mdash;or to the rain which brings
back the water evaporated from the surface of the
streams and of the sea. The reference is, rather, to
an ancient conception of the physical order of nature
held by the Hebrew as by other races, according to
which the ocean, fed by the streams, sent back a
constant supply through subterraneous passages and
channels, in which the salt was filtered out of it;
through these they supposed the rivers to return to
the place whence they came. The ruling sentiment
of these verses is that, while all the natural elements
and forces, even the most variable and inconstant,
renew their strength and return upon their course,
for frail man there is no return; permanence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
uniformity characterise <i>them</i>, while transitoriness and
instability mark <i>him</i> for their own. They seem to
vanish and disappear; the sun sinks, the winds lull,
the streams run dry; but they all come back again:
for him there is no coming back; once gone, he is
gone for ever.</p>

<p>But it is vain to talk of these or other instances
of the weary yet restless activity of the universe;
"man cannot utter it." For, besides these elemental
illustrations, the world is crowded with illustrations
of incessant change, which yet move within narrow
bounds and do nothing to relieve its sameliness.
So numerous are they, so innumerable, that the
curious eye and inquisitive ear of man would be
worn out before they had completed the tale of them:
and if eye and ear could never be satisfied with
hearing and seeing, how much less the slower tongue
with speaking (ver. 8)? All through the universe
what hath been still is and will be; what was done
is done still and always will be done; the sun still
running the same race, the winds still blowing from
the same points, the streams still flowing between
the same banks and returning by the same channels.
If any man suppose that he has discovered new
phenomena, any natural fact which has not been
repeating itself from the beginning, it is only because
he is ignorant of that which has been from of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
(vv. 9, 10).<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Yet, while in nature all things return
on their course and abide for ever, man's day is soon
spent, his force soon exhausted. <i>He</i> does not return;
nay, he is not so much as remembered by those who
come after him. Just as we have forgotten those
who were before us, so those who live after us will
forget us (ver. 11). The burden of all this unintelligible
world lies heavily on the Preacher's soul.
He is weary of the world's "everlasting sameness."
The miseries and confusions of the human lot baffle
and oppress his thoughts. Above all, the contrast
between Nature and Man, between its massive and
stately permanence and the frailty and brevity of our
existence, breeds in him the despairing mood of which
we have the keynote in his cry, "Vanity of vanities,
vanity of vanities, all is vanity!"</p>

<p>Yet this is not the only, not the inevitable, mood of
the mind as it ponders that great contrast. <i>We</i> have
learned to look upon it with other, perhaps with wider,
eyes. We say, How grand, how soothing, how hopeful
is the spectacle of nature's uniformity! How it lifts
us above the fluctuations of inward thought, and
gladdens us with a sense of stability and repose! As
we see the ancient inviolable laws working out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the same gracious and beautiful results day after day
and year by year, and reflect that "what has been will
be," we are redeemed from our bondage to vanity and
corruption; we look up with composed and reverent
trust to Him who is our God and Father, and onward
to the stable and glorious immortality we are to spend
with Him; we argue with Habakkuk (chap. i. ver. 12),
"Art not <i>Thou</i> from everlasting, O Lord our God, our
Holy One? <i>We</i> shall not die," but live.</p>

<p>But if we did not know the Ruler of the universe to
be our God and Father; if our thoughts had still to
"jump the life to come" or to leap at it with a mere
guess; if we had to cross the gulf of death on no more
solid bridge than a Peradventure; if, in short, our life
were infinitely more troubled and uncertain than it is,
and the true good of life and its bright sustaining hope
were still to seek, how would it be with us then?
Then, like the Preacher, we might feel the steadfastness
and uniformity of nature as an affront to our vanity
and weakness. In place of drinking in hope and composure
from the fair visage and unbroken order of the
universe, we might deem its face to be darkened with
a frown or its eye to be glancing on us with bitter irony.
Instead of finding in its inevitable order and permanence
a hopeful prophecy of <i>our</i> recovery into an unbroken
order and an enduring peace, we might passionately
demand why, on an abiding earth and under an unchanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
heaven, we should die and be forgotten; why,
more inconstant than the variable wind, more evanescent
than the parching stream, one generation should go
never to return, and another generation come to enjoy
the gains of those who were before them, and to blot
their memory from the earth.</p>

<p>This, indeed, <i>has</i> been the impassioned protest and
outcry of every age. Literature is full of it. The
contrast between the tranquil unchanging sky, with its
myriads of pure lustrous stars, which are always there
and always in a happy concert, and the frailty of man
rushing blindly through his brief and perturbed course
has lent its ground-tones to the poetry of every race.
We meet it everywhere. It is the oldest of old songs.
In all the many languages of the divided earth we hear
how the generations of men pass swifty and stormfully
across its bosom, "searching the serene heavens with
the inquest of their beseeching looks," but winning no
response; asking always, and always in vain, "Why
are we thus? why are we thus? frail as the moth, and
of few days like the flower?" It is this contrast
between the serenity and the stability of nature and the
frailty and turbulence of man which afflicts Coheleth
and drives him to conclusions of despair. Here is
man, "so noble in reason, so infinite in faculty, in
apprehension so like a god," longing with an ardent
intensity for the peace which results from the equipoise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and happy occupation of his various powers; and yet
his whole life is wasted in labours and tumults, in perplexity
and strife; he goes to his grave with his cravings
unsatisfied, his powers untrained, unharmonised,
knowing no rest till he lies in the narrow bed from
which is no uprising! What wonder if to such an one
as he "this goodly frame, the earth, seems but a
sterile promontory" stretching out a little space into the
dark, infinite void; "this most excellent canopy, the air
... this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire," nothing but "a foul,
pestilential congregation of vapours"? What wonder
if, for him, the very beauty of nature should turn into
a repulsive hideousness, and its steadfast, unchanging
order be held a satire on the disorder and vanity of
his life?</p>

<p>Solomon, moreover,&mdash;and Solomon in his premature
old age, sated and weary, is the mask under which the
Preacher conceals his natural face,&mdash;had had a large
experience of life, had tried its ambitions, its lusts, its
pursuits and pleasures; he had tested every promise
of good which it held forth, and found them all illusory;
he had drunk of every stream, and found no pure living
water with which he could slake his thirst. And men
such as he, sated but not satisfied, jaded with voluptuous
delights and without the peace of faith, commonly look
out on the world with haggard eyes. They feed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
despair on the natural order and purity which they feel
to be a rebuke to the impurity of their own restless and
perturbed hearts. Many of us have, no doubt, stood
on Richmond Hill, and looked with softening eyes on
the rich pastures dotted with cattle, and broken with
clumps of trees through which shoot up village spires,
while the full, placid Thames winds in many a curve
through pasture and wood. It is not a grand or romantic
scene; but on a quiet evening, in the long level rays
of the setting sun, it is a scene to inspire content and
thankful, peaceful thoughts. Wilberforce tells us that
he once stood in the balcony of a villa looking down
on this scene. Beside him stood the owner of the
villa, a duke notorious for his profligacy in a profligate
age; and as they looked across the stream, the duke
cried out, "O that river! there it runs, on and on, and
I so weary of it!" And <i>there</i> you have the very
mood of this Prologue; the mood for which the fair,
smiling heavens and the gracious, bountiful earth carry
no benediction of peace, because they are reflected from
a heart all tossed into crossing and impure waves.</p>

<p>All things depend on the heart we bring to them.
This very contrast between Nature and Man has no
despair in it, breeds no dispeace or anger in the heart
at leisure from itself and at peace with God. Tennyson,
for instance, makes a merry musical brook sing to us
on this very theme.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is the very plaint of the Preacher set to sweet music.
He murmurs, "One generation passeth, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
generation cometh, but the earth abideth for ever;"
while the refrain of the Brook is,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"For men may come and men may go,</span>
<span class="i1">But I go on for ever."</span>
</div>

<p>Yet we do not feel that the Song of the Brook should
feed any mood of grief and despair. The tune that it
sings to the sleeping woods all night is "a cheerful
tune." By some subtle process we are made to share
us bright, tender hilarity, though we too are of the men
that come and go. Into what a fume would the Hebrew
Preacher have been thrown had any little "babbling
brook" dared to sing this saucy song <i>to him</i>. He would
have felt it as an insult, and have assumed that the
merry, innocent creature was "crowing" over the swiftly
passing generations of men. But, for the Christian
Poet, the Brook sings a song whose blithe dulcet strain
attunes the heart to the quiet harmonies of peace and
good-will.</p>

<p>Again I say all depends on the heart we turn to
nature. It was because his heart was heavy with the
memory of many sins and many failures, because too
the lofty Christian hopes were beyond his reach, that
this "son of David" grew mournful and bitter in her
presence.</p>

<p>This, then, is the mood in which the Preacher commences
his quest of the Chief Good. He is driven to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
it by the need of finding that in which he can rest. As
a rule, it is only on the most stringent compulsions
that we any of us undertake this high Quest. Of their
profound need of a Chief Good most men are but
seldom and faintly conscious; but to the favoured few,
who are to lead and mould the public thought, it comes
with a force they cannot resist. It was thus with
Coheleth. He could not endure to think that those
who have "all things put under their feet" should lie
at the mercy of accidents from which their realm
is exempt; that <i>they</i> should be the mere fools of change,
while <i>that</i> abides unchanged for ever. And, therefore,
he set out to discover the conditions on which they
might become partakers of the order and stability and
peace of nature; the conditions on which, raised above
all the tides and storms of change, they might sit calm
and serene even though the heavens should be folded
as a scroll and the earth be shaken from its foundations.
This, and only this, will he recognise as the Chief
Good, the Good appropriate to the nature of man,
because capable of satisfying all his cravings and
supplying all his wants.</p>

<h2>FIRST SECTION.</h2>

<h3><i>THE QUEST OF THE CHIEF GOOD IN WISDOM
AND IN PLEASURE.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chap. I., Ver. 12, to Chap. II., Ver. 26.</span></p>


<p>Oppressed by his profound sense of the vanity
of the life which man lives amid the play of permanent
natural forces, Coheleth sets out on the search
for that true and supreme Good which it will be well
for the sons of men to pursue through their brief day;
the good which will sustain them under all their toils,
and be "a portion" so large and enduring as to satisfy
even their vast desires.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
Wisdom.</i>
Ch. i., vv. 12-18.</div>

<p>1. And, as was natural in so wise a man, he turns
first to <i>Wisdom</i>. He gives himself diligently to inquire
into all the actions and toils of men. He
will ascertain whether a larger acquaintance
with their conditions, a deeper
insight into the facts, a more just and complete estimate
of their lot, will remove the depression which weighs
upon his heart. He devotes himself earnestly to this
Quest, and acquires a "greater wisdom than all who
were before him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>This wisdom, however, is not a scientific knowledge
of facts or of social and political laws, nor is it the
result of philosophical speculations on "the first good or
the first fair," or on the nature and constitution of man.
It is the wisdom that is born of wide and varied experience,
not of abstract study. He acquaints himself with
the facts of human life, with the circumstances, thoughts,
feelings, hopes, and aims of all sorts and conditions
of men. He is fain to know "all that men do under
the sun," "all that is done under heaven." Like the
Arabian Caliph, "the good Haroun Alraschid," we
may suppose that Coheleth goes forth in disguise to
visit all quarters of the city; to talk with barbers,
druggists, calenders, porters, with merchants and
mariners, husbandmen and tradesmen, mechanics and
artizans; to try conclusions with travellers and with the
blunt wits of home-keeping men. He will look with
his own eyes and learn for himself what their lives are
like, how they conceive of the human lot, and what,
if any, are the mysteries which sadden and perplex
them. He will ascertain whether <i>they</i> have any key
that will unlock his perplexities, any wisdom that will
solve his problems or help him to bear his burden with
a more cheerful heart. Because his depression was fed
by every fresh contemplation of the order of the
universe, he turns from nature to "the proper study
of mankind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>But this also he finds a heavy and disappointing
task. After a wide and dispassionate scrutiny, when
he has "seen <i>much</i> wisdom and knowledge," he concludes
that man has no fair reward "for all his labour
that he laboureth under the sun," that no wisdom
avails to set straight that which is crooked in human
affairs, or to supply that which is lacking in them.
The sense of vanity bred by his contemplation of the
stedfast round of nature only grows more profound
and more painful as he reflects on the numberless and
manifold disorders which afflict humanity. And hence,
before he ventures on a new experiment, he makes a
pathetic appeal to the heart which he had so earnestly
applied to the search, and in which he had stored up
so large and various a knowledge, and confesses that
"even this is vexation of spirit," that "in much wisdom
is much sadness," and that "to multiply knowledge is
to multiply sorrow."</p>

<p>And whether we consider the nature of the case or
the conditions of the time in which this Book was
written, we shall not be surprised at the mournful
conclusion to which he comes. For the time was full
of cruel oppressions and wrongs. Life was insecure.
To acquire property was to court extortion. The
Hebrews, and even the conquering race which ruled
them, were slaves to the caprice of satraps and
magistrates whose days were wasted in revelry and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the unbridled indulgence of their lusts. And to go
among the various conditions of men groaning under
a despotism like that of the Turk, whose foot strikes
with barrenness every spot on which it treads; to see
all the fair rewards of honest toil withheld, the noble
degraded and the foolish exalted, the righteous trodden
down by the feet of the wicked; all this was not likely
to quicken cheerful thoughts in a wise man's heart:
instead of solving, it could but complicate and darken
the problems over which he was already brooding in
despair.</p>

<p>And, apart from the special wrongs and oppressions
of the time, it is inevitable that the thoughtful student
of men and manners should become a sadder as he
becomes a wiser man. To multiply knowledge, at
least of this kind, <i>is</i> to multiply sorrow. We need not
be cynics and leave our tub only to reflect on the
dishonesty of our neighbours, we need only go through
the world with open and observant eyes in order to
learn that "in much wisdom is much sadness." Recall
the wisest of modern times, those who have had the
most intimate acquaintance with man and men, Goethe
and Carlyle for example; are they not all touched with
a profound sadness?<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Do they not look with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
scorn on the common life of the mass of men, with its
base passions and pleasures, struggles and rewards?
and, in proportion as they have the spirit of Christ, is
not their very scorn kindly, springing from a pity
which lies deeper than itself? Did not even the
Master Himself, though full of ruth and grace, share
their feeling as He saw publicans growing rich by
extortion, hypocrites mounting to Moses' chair, subtle,
cruel foxes couched on thrones, scribes hiding the key
of knowledge, and the blind multitude following their
blind leaders into the ditch?</p>

<p>Nay, if we look out on the world of to-day, can we
say that even the majority of men are wise and pure?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Is it always the swift who win the race, and the strong
who carry off the honours of the battle? Do none of
our "intelligent lack bread," nor any of the learned
favour? Are there no fools lifted to high places to
show with how little wisdom the world is governed,
and no brave and noble breasts dinted by the blows
of hostile circumstances or wounded by "the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune"? Are all our workmen
diligent and all our masters fair? Are no false
measures and balances known in our markets, and no
frauds on our exchanges? Are none of our homes
dungeons, with fathers and husbands for jailors? Do
we never hear, as we stand without, the sound of cruel
blows and the shrieks of tortured captives? Are there
no hypocrites in our Churches "that with devotion's
visage sugar o'er" a corrupt heart? And do the best
men always gain the highest place and honour? Are
there none in our midst who have to bear&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">"The whips and scorns of time,</span>
<span class="i0">The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</span>
<span class="i0">The pangs of despised love, the laws delay.</span>

<span class="i0">That patient merit of the unworthy takes"?</span>
</div>

<p>Alas, if we think to find the true Good in a wide and
varied knowledge of the conditions of men, their hopes
and fears, their struggles and successes, their loves
and hates, their rights and wrongs, their pleasures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
their pains, we shall but share the defeat of the Preacher,
and repeat his bitter cry, "Vanity of vanities, vanity
of vanities, all is vanity!" For, as he himself implies at
the very outset (ver. 13), "this sore task," this eternal
quest of a wisdom which will solve the problems and
remove the inequalities of human life, is God's <i>gift</i> to
the children of men,&mdash;this search for a solution they
never reach. Age after age, unwarned by the failure
of those who took this road before them, they renew
the hopeless quest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
Pleasure.</i>
Ch. ii., vv. 1-11.</div>

<p>2. But if we cannot reach the object of our Quest
in Wisdom, we may, perchance, find it in Pleasure.
This experiment also the Preacher has
tried, tried on the largest scale and
under the most auspicious conditions.
Wisdom failing to satisfy the large desires of his soul,
or even to lift it from its depression, he turns to
mirth.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Once more, as he forthwith announces, he is
disappointed in the result. He pronounces mirth a
brief madness; in itself, like wisdom, a good, it is not
the Chief Good; to make it supreme is to rob it of its
natural charm.</p>

<p>Not content with this general verdict, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
recounts the details of his experiment, that he may
deter us from repeating it. Speaking in the person
of Solomon and utilising the facts of <i>his</i> experience,
Coheleth claims to have started in the quest with the
greatest advantages; for "what can he do who cometh
after the king whom they made king long ago?" He
surrounded himself with all the luxuries of an Oriental
prince, not out of any vulgar love of show and
ostentation, nor out of any strong sensual addictions,
but that he might discover wherein the secret and
fascination of pleasure lay, and what it could do for a
man who pursued it wisely. He built himself new,
costly palaces, as the Sultan of Turkey used to do
almost every year. He laid out paradises, planted
them with vines and fruit-trees of every sort, and large
shady groves to screen off and attemper the heat of the
sun.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He dug great tanks and reservoirs of water, and
cut channels which carried the cool vital stream through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the gardens and to the roots of the trees. He bought
men and maids, and surrounded himself with the
retinue of servants and slaves requisite to keep his
palaces and paradises in order, to serve his sumptuous
tables, to swell his pomp: <i>i.e.</i> he gathered together
such a train of ministers, attendants, domestics, indoor
and outdoor slaves, as is still thought necessary to the
dignity of an Oriental "lord." His herds of flocks, a
main source of Oriental wealth, were of finer strain and
larger in number than had been known before. He
amassed enormous treasures of silver and gold, the
common Oriental hoard. He collected the peculiar
treasures "of kings and of the kingdoms;" whatever
special commodity was yielded by any foreign land was
caught up for his use by his officers or presented to
him by his allies.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He hired famous musicians and
singers, and gave himself to those delights of harmony
which have had a peculiar charm for the Hebrews of
all ages. He crowded his harem with the beauties
both of his own and of foreign lands. He withheld
nothing from them that his eyes desired, and kept not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his heart from any pleasure. He set himself seriously
and intelligently to make happiness his portion; and,
while cherishing or cheering his body with pleasures,
he did not rush into them with the blind eagerness
"whose violent property foredoes itself" and defeats
its own ends. His "mind guided him wisely" amid
his delights; his "wisdom helped him" to select, and
combine, and vary them, to enhance and prolong their
sweetness by a certain art and temperance in me
enjoyment of them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"He built his soul a lordly pleasure-house,</span>
<span class="i1">Wherein at ease for aye to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">He said, 'Oh Soul, make merry and carouse,</span>
<span class="i0">Dear Soul, for all is well!'"</span>
</div>

<p>Alas, all was <i>not</i> well, though he took much pains to
make and think it well. Even his choice delights soon
palled upon his taste, and brought on conclusions of
disgust. Even in his lordly pleasure-house he was
haunted by the grim, menacing spectres which troubled
him before it was built. In the harem, in the paradise
he had planted, under the groves, beside the fountains,
at the sumptuous banquet,&mdash;a bursting bubble, a falling
leaf, an empty wine cup, a passing blush, sufficed to
bring back the thought of the brevity and the emptiness
of life. When he had run the full career of pleasure,
and turned to contemplate his delights and the labour
they had cost him, he found that these also were vanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and vexation of spirit, that there was no "profit" in
them, that they could not satisfy the deep, incessant
craving of the soul for a true and lasting Good.</p>

<p>Is not his sad verdict as true as it is sad? We
have not his wealth of resources. Nevertheless there
may have been a time when our hearts were as intent
on pleasure as was his. We may have pursued whatever
sensuous, intellectual, or aesthetic excitements
were open to us with a growing eagerness till we have
lived in a whirl of craving and stimulating desire and
indulgence, in which the claims of duty have been
neglected and the rebukes of conscience unheeded.
And if we <i>have</i> passed through this experience, if we
have been carried for a time into this giddying round,
have we not come out of it jaded, exhausted, despising
ourselves for our folly, disgusted with what once
seemed the very top and crown of delight? Do we
not mourn, our after life through, over energies wasted
and opportunities lost? Are we not sadder, if wiser,
men for our brief frenzy? As we return to the sober
duties and simple joys of life, do not <i>we</i> say to Mirth,
"Thou art mad!" and to Pleasure, "What canst thou
do for us?" Yes, our verdict is that of the Preacher,
"Lo, this too is vanity!" <i>Non enim hilaritate, nec
lascivia, nec visu, aut joco, comite levitatis, sed sæpe etiam
tristes firmitate, et constantia sunt beati.</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Wisdom and
Mirth compared.</i>
Ch. ii., vv. 12-23.</div>

<p>It is characteristic of the philosophic temper of our
Author, I think, that, after pronouncing Wisdom and
Mirth vanities in which the true Good is
not to be found, he does not at once
proceed to try a new experiment, but
pauses to compare these two "vanities," and to
reason out his preference of one over the other. <i>His</i>
vanity is wisdom. For it is only in one respect that
he puts mirth and wisdom on an equality, viz. that
they neither of them are, or lead up to, the supreme
Good. In all other respects he affirms wisdom to be
as much better than pleasure as light is better than
darkness, as much better as it is to have eyes that see
the light than to be blind and walk in a constant gloom
(<span class="smcap">vv.</span> 12-14). It is because wisdom is a light and
enables men to see that he accords it his preference.
It is by the light of wisdom that he has learned the
vanity of mirth, nay, the insufficiency of wisdom itself.
But for that light he might still be pursuing pleasures
which could not satisfy, or laboriously acquiring a
knowledge which would only deepen his sadness.
Wisdom had opened his eyes to see that he must seek
the Good which gives rest and peace in other regions.
He no longer goes on his Quest in utter blindness, with
all the world before him where to choose, but with no
indication of the course he should, or should not, take.
He has already learned that two large provinces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
human life will not yield him what he seeks, that he
must expend no more of his brief day and failing
energies on these.</p>

<p>Therefore wisdom is better than mirth. Nevertheless
it is not best, nor can it remove the dejections
of a thoughtful heart. Somewhere there is, there
must be, that which is better still. For wisdom
cannot explain to him why the same fate should befall
both the sage and the fool (ver. 15), nor can it abate
the anger that burns within him against an injustice
so obvious and flagrant. Wisdom cannot even explain
why, even if the sage must die no less than the fool,
both must be forgotten wellnigh as soon as they are
gone (vv. 16, 17); nor can it soften the hatred of life
and its labours which this lesser yet patent injustice
has kindled in his heart. Nay, wisdom, for all so
brightly as it shines, throws no light on an injustice
which, if of lower degree, frets and perplexes his mind,&mdash;why
a man who has laboured prudently and dexterously
and has acquired great gains should, when he
dies, leave all to one who has not laboured therein,
without even the poor consolation of knowing whether
he will be a wise man or an idiot (vv. 19-21). In
short, the whole skein of life is in a dismal tangle which
wisdom itself, dearly as he loves it, cannot unravel;
and the tangle is that man has no fair "profit" from
his labours, "since his task grieveth and vexeth him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
all his days, and even at night his heart hath no rest;"
and when he dies he loses all his gains, such as they
are, for ever, and cannot so much as be sure that
his heir will be any the better for them. "This also
is vanity" (vv. 22, 23).</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Conclusion.</i>
Ch. ii. vv. 24-26.</div>

<p>And yet, good things are surely good, and there is
a wise and gracious enjoyment of earthly delights.
It is right that a man should eat and
drink, and take a natural pleasure in
his toils and gains. Who, indeed, has a stronger
claim than the labourer himself to eat and enjoy the
fruit of his labours? Still, even this natural enjoyment
is the gift of God; apart from his blessing
the heaviest toils will produce but a scanty harvest,
and the faculty of enjoying that harvest may be
lacking. It <i>is</i> lacking to the sinner; <i>his</i> task is to
heap up gains which the good will inherit. But he
that is good before God will have the gains of the
sinner added to his own, with wisdom to enjoy both.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
This, whatever appearances may sometimes suggest, is
the law of God's giving: that the good shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
abundance, while the bad lack; that more shall be
given to him who has wisdom to use what he has
aright, while from him who is destitute of this wisdom,
even that which he hath shall be taken away. Nevertheless
even this wise use and enjoyment of temporal
good does not and cannot satisfy the craving heart of
man; even this, when it is made the ruling aim and
chief good of life, is vexation of spirit.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Thus the First Act of the Drama closes with a
negative. The moral problem is as far from being
solved as at the outset. All we have learned is that
one or two avenues along which we urge the Quest
will not lead us to the end we seek. As yet the
Preacher has only the <i>ad interim</i> conclusion to offer us,
that both Wisdom and Mirth are good, though neither,
nor both combined, is the supreme Good; that we are
therefore to acquire wisdom and knowledge, and to
blend pleasure with our toils; that we are to believe
pleasure and wisdom to be the gifts of God, to believe
also that they are bestowed, not in caprice, but according
to a law which deals out good to the good and
evil to the evil. We shall have other opportunities of
weighing and appraising his counsel&mdash;it is often repeated&mdash;and
of seeing how it works into and forms part of
Coheleth's final solution of the painful riddle of the
earth, the baffling mystery of life.</p>

<h2>SECOND SECTION.</h2>

<h3><i>THE QUEST OF THE CHIEF GOOD IN DEVOTION
TO THE AFFAIRS OF BUSINESS.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chap. III., Ver. 1, to Chap. V., Ver. 20.</span></p>


<p>I. If the true Good is not to be found in the School
where Wisdom utters her voice, nor in the
Garden in which Pleasure spreads her lures: may it
not be found in the Market, in devotion to Business and
Public Affairs? The Preacher will try this experiment
also. He gives himself to study and consider it. But
at the very outset he discovers that he is in the
iron grip of immutable Divine ordinances, by which
"seasons" are appointed for every undertaking under
heaven (ver. 1), ordinances which derange man's best-laid
schemes, and "shape his ends, rough-hew them
how he will," that no one can do anything to purpose
"apart from God," except by conforming to the ordinances,
or laws, in which He has expressed His
will (comp. chap, ii., vv. 24-26).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest obstructed
by
Divine
Ordinances</i>;
Ch. iii., vv. 1-15.</div>

<p>The time of birth, for instance, and the time of
death, are ordained by a Power over which men
have no control; they begin to be, and they cease to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
be, at hours whose stroke they can neither hasten nor
retard. The season for sowing and the season for
reaping are fixed without any reference to their wish;
they must plant and gather in when the
unchangeable laws of nature will permit
(ver. 2). Even those violent deaths, and
those narrow escapes from death, which
seem most purely fortuitous, are predetermined; as are
also the accidents which befall our abodes (ver. 3). So,
again, if only because determined by these accidents, are
the feelings with which we regard them, our weeping and
our laughter, our mourning and our rejoicing (ver. 4).
If we only clear a plot of ground from stones in order
that we may cultivate it, or that we may fence it in
with a wall; or if an enemy cast stones over our arable
land to unfit it for uses of husbandry&mdash;a malignant act
frequent in the East&mdash;and we have painfully to gather
them out again: even this, which seems so purely
within the scope of human free-will, is also within the
scope of the Divine decrees&mdash;as are the very embraces
we bestow on those dear to us, or withhold from them
(ver. 5). The varying and unstable desires which
prompt us to seek this object or that as earnestly as
we afterwards carelessly cast it away, and the passions
which impel us to rend our garments over our losses,
and by-and-bye to sew up the rents not without some
little wonder that we should ever have been so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
moved by that which now sits so lightly on us; these
passions and desires, which at one time strike us dumb
with grief and so soon after make us voluble with joy,
with all our fleeting and easily-moved hates and loves,
strifes and reconciliations, move within the circle of
law, although they wear so lawless a look, and are
obsequious to the fixed canons of Heaven (vv. 6-8).
They travel their cycles; they return in their appointed
order. The uniformity of nature is reproduced in the
uniform recurrence of the chances and changes of human
life; for in this, as in that, God repeats Himself, recalling
the past (ver. 15). The thing that is is that
which hath been, and that which will be. Social laws
are as constant and as inflexible as natural laws. The
social generalisations of modern science&mdash;as given, for
instance, in Buckle's <i>History</i>&mdash;are but a methodical
elaboration of the conclusion at which the Preacher
here arrives.</p>

<p>Of what use, then, was it for men to "kick against
the goads," to attempt to modify immutable ordinances?
"Whatever God hath ordained continueth
for ever; nothing can be added to it, and nothing
can be taken from it" (ver. 14). Nay, why should
we care to alter or modify the social order? Everything
is beautiful and appropriate in its season, from
birth to death, from war to peace (ver. 11). If we cannot
find the satisfying Good in the events and affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of life, that is not because we could devise a happier
order for them, but because "God hath put <i>eternity</i> into
our hearts" as well as time, and did not intend that we
should be satisfied till we attain an eternal good. If
only we "understood" that, if only we recognised
Gods design for us "from beginning to end," and
suffered eternity no less than time to have its due of
us, we should not fret ourselves in vain endeavours to
change the unchangeable, or to find an enduring good
in that which is fugitive and perishable. We should
rejoice and do ourselves good all our brief life (Ver. 12);
we should eat and drink and take pleasure in our
labours (ver. 13); we should feel that this faculty for
innocently enjoying simple pleasures and wholesome
toils is "a gift of God:" we should conclude that God
had ordained that regular cycle and order of events
which so often forestalls the wish and endeavour of
the moment, in order that we should fear Him in place
of relying on ourselves (ver. 14), and trust our future
to Him who so wisely and graciously recalls the past.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>And by Human
Injustice and
Perversity.</i>
Ch. iii., v. 16.-Ch.
iv., v. 3.</div>

<p>But not only are our endeavours to find the "good"
of our labours thwarted by the gracious,
inflexible laws of the just God; they are
often baffled by the injustice of ungracious
men. In the days of Coheleth, Iniquity
sat in the seat of justice, wresting all rules of equity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
its base private ends (ver. 16). Unjust judges and
rapacious satraps put the fair rewards of labour and
skill and integrity in jeopardy, insomuch that if a man
by industry and thrift, by a wise observance of Divine
laws and by taking occasions as they rose, had acquired
affluence, he was too often, in the expressive Eastern
phrase, but as a sponge which any petty despot might
squeeze. The frightful oppressions of the time were a
heavy burden to the Hebrew Preacher. He brooded
over them, seeking for aids to faith and comfortable
words wherewith to solace the oppressed. For a
moment he thought he had lit on the true comfort,
"Well, well," he said within himself, "<i>God</i> will judge
the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time for
everything and for every deed with Him" (ver. 17).
Could he have rested in this thought, it would have
been "a sovereign balm" to him, or indeed to any
other Hebrew; although to us, who have learned to
desire the redemption rather than the punishment of
the wicked, their redemption <i>through</i> their inevitable
punishments, the true comfort would still have been
wanting. But he could not rest in it, could not hold
it fast, and confesses that he could not. He lays his
heart bare before us. We are permitted to trace the
fluctuating thoughts and emotions which swept across
it. No sooner has he whispered to his heart that God,
who is at leisure from Himself and has endless time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
his command, will visit the oppressors and avenge the
oppressed, than his thoughts take a new turn, and he
adds: "And yet God <i>may</i> have sifted the children of
men only to shew them that they are no better than the
beasts" (ver. 18): <i>this</i> may be his aim in all the wrongs
by which they are tried. Repugnant as the thought
is, it nevertheless fascinates him for the instant, and he
yields to its wasting and degrading magic. He not
only fears, suspects, thinks that man is no better than
a beast; he is quite sure of it, and proceeds to argue
it out. His argument is very sweeping, very sombre.
"A mere chance is man, and the beast a mere chance."
Both spring from a mere accident, no one can tell how,
and have a blind hazard for a creator; and "both are
subject to the same chance," or mischance, throughout
their lives, all the decisions of their intelligence and
will being overruled by the decrees of an inscrutable
fate. Both perish under the same power of death,
suffer the same pangs of dissolution, are taken at unawares
by the same invisible yet resistless force. The
bodies of both spring from the same dust, and moulder
back into dust. Nay, "both have the same spirit;"
and though vain man sometimes boasts that at death
his spirit goeth upward, while that of the beast goeth
downward, yet who can prove it? For himself, and in
his present mood, Coheleth doubts, and even denies it.
He is absolutely convinced that in origin and life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
death, in body and spirit and final fate, man is as
the beast is, and hath no advantage over the beast
(vv. 19-21). And therefore he falls back on his old
conclusion, though now with a sadder heart than ever,
that man will do wisely, that, being so blind and
having so dark a prospect, he cannot do more wisely
than to take what pleasure and enjoy what good he
can amid his labours. <i>If</i> he is a beast, <i>as</i> he is a
beast, let him at least learn of the beasts that simple,
tranquil enjoyment of the good of the passing moment,
untroubled by any vexing presage of what is to come,
in which it must be allowed that they are greater
proficients than he (ver. 22).</p>

<p>Thus, after rising in the first fifteen verses of
this Third Chapter, to an almost Christian height of
patience, and resignation, and holy trust in the providence
of God, Coheleth is smitten by the injustice
and oppressions of man into the depths of a pessimistic
materialism.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But now a new question arises. The Preacher's
survey of human life has shaken his faith even in the
conclusion which he has announced from the first, viz.,
that there is nothing better for a man than a quiet
content, a busy cheerfulness, a tranquil enjoyment of
the fruit of his toils. <i>This</i> at least he has supposed to
be possible: but is it? All the activities, industries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
tranquillities of life are jeopardised, now by the inflexible
ordinances of Heaven, and again by the capricious
tyranny of man. To this tyranny his fellow-countrymen
are now exposed. They groan under its heaviest
oppressions. As he turns and once more reflects
(chap. iv., ver. 1) on their unalleviated and unfriended
misery, he doubts whether content, or even resignation,
can be expected of them. With a tender sympathy
that lingers on the details of their unhappy lot, and
deepens into a passionate and despairing melancholy,
he witnesses their sufferings and "counts the tears"
of the oppressed. With the emphasis of a Hebrew
and an Oriental, he marks and emphasises the fact that
"they had no comforter," that though "their oppressors
were violent, yet they had no comforter." For throughout
the East, and among the Jews to this day, the
manifestation of sympathy with those who suffer is far
more common and ceremonious than it is with us.
Neighbours and acquaintances are expected to pay long
visits of condolence; friends and kinsfolk will travel
long distances to pay them. Their respective places
and duties in the house of mourning, their dress, words,
bearing, precedence, are regulated by an ancient and
elaborate etiquette. And, strange as it may seem to
us, these visits are regarded not only as gratifying
tokens of respect to the dead, but as a singular relief
and comfort to the living. To the Preacher and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
fellow-captives, therefore, it would be a bitter aggravation
of their grief that, while suffering under the most
cruel oppressions of misfortune, they were compelled
to forego the solace of these customary tokens of
respect and sympathy. As he pondered their sad and
unfriended condition, Coheleth&mdash;like Job, when his
comforters failed him&mdash;is moved to curse his day.
The dead, he affirms, are happier than the living,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>&mdash;even
the dead who died so long ago that the fate most
dreaded in the East had befallen them, and the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
memory of them had perished from the earth: while
happier than either the dead, who have had to suffer in
their time, or than the living, whose doom had still to
be borne, were those who had never seen the light,
never been born into a world all disordered and out
of course (vv. 2, 3).<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>It is rendered
hopeless by the
base origin of
Human Industries.</i>
Ch. iv., vv. 4-8.</div>

<p>This stinging sense of the miserable estate of his
race has, however, diverted the Preacher from the conduct
of the main argument he had in
hand: to that he now returns (ver. 4).
And now he argues: You cannot hope
get good fruit from a bad root. But
the several industries in which you are
tempted to seek "the chief good and market of your
time" have a most base and evil origin; they "spring
from man's jealous rivalry with his neighbour." Every
man tries to outdo and to outsell his neighbours; to
secure a larger business, to surround himself with a
more profuse luxury, or to amass an ampler hoard of
gold. This business life of yours is utterly selfish,
and therefore utterly base. You are not content with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sufficient provision for simple wants. You do not seek
your neighbour's good. You have no noble or patriotic
aim. Your ruling intention is to enrich yourselves at
the expense of neighbours who, in their turn, are <i>your</i>
rivals rather than your neighbours, and who try to get
the better of you just as you try to get the better of
them. Can you hope to find the true Good in a life
whose aims are so sordid, whose motives so selfish?
The very sluggard who folds his hands in indolence so
long as he has bread to eat is a wiser man than you;
for he has at least his "handful of quiet," and knows
some little enjoyment of life; while you, driven on
by jealous competition and the eager cravings of insatiable
desire, have neither leisure nor appetite for
enjoyment: both your hands are full, indeed, but there
is no quiet in them, only labour, labour, labour, with
vexation of spirit (vv. 5, 6).</p>

<p>So intense and selfish was this rivalry, increase of
appetite growing by what it fed upon, so keen grew the
desire to amass, that the Preacher paints a portrait, for
which no doubt many <i>a Hebrew</i> might have sat, of a
man&mdash;nay, rather, of a miser&mdash;who, though solitary
and kinless, with not even a son or a brother to inherit
his wealth, nevertheless hoards up riches to the close
of his life; there is no end to his labours; he never
can be rich enough to allow himself any enjoyment of
his gains (vv. 7, 8).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Yet these are
capable of a
nobler Motive
and Mode.</i>
Ch. iv., vv. 9-16.</div>

<p>Now a jealous rivalry culminating in mere avarice,&mdash;that
surely is not the wisest or noblest spirit of which
those are capable who devote themselves
to affairs. Even "the idols of
the market" may have a purer cult.
Business, like Wisdom or Mirth, may
neither be, nor contain, the supreme Good: still, like
them, it is not in itself and of necessity an evil. There
must be a better mode of devotion to it than this selfish
and greedy one; and such a mode Coheleth, before he
pursues his argument to a close, pauses to point out.
As if anticipating a modern theory which grows in
favour with the wiser sort of mercantile men, he
suggests that co-operation&mdash;of course I use the word
in its etymological rather than in its technical sense&mdash;should
be substituted for competition. "Two are better
than one," he argues; "union is better than isolation;
conjoint labour brings the larger reward" (ver. 9). To
bring his suggestion home to the business bosom of
men, he uses five illustrations, four of which have a
strong Oriental colouring.</p>

<p>The first is that of two pedestrians (ver. 10); if one
should fall&mdash;and such an accident, owing to the bad
roads and long cumbrous robes common in the East,
was by no means infrequent&mdash;the other is ready to
set him on his feet; while, if he is alone, the least
that can befall him is that his robe will be trampled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and bemired before he can gather himself up again.
In the second illustration (ver. 11), our two travellers,
wearied by their journey, sleep together at its close.
Now in Syria the nights are often keen and frosty,
and the heat of the day makes men more susceptible
to the cold. The sleeping-chambers, moreover, have
only unglazed lattices which let in the frosty air as
well as the welcome light; the bed is commonly a
simple mat, the bedclothes only the garments worn
through the day. And therefore the natives huddle
together for the sake of warmth. To lie alone was to
lie shivering in the chill night air. The third illustration
(ver. 12) is also taken from the East. Our two
travellers, lying snug and warm on their common mat,
buried in slumber, that "dear repose for limbs with
travel tired," were very likely to be disturbed by thieves
who had dug a hole through the clay walls of the
house, or crept under the tent, to carry off what they
could. These thieves, always on the alert for travellers,
are marvellously supple, rapid, and silent in their
movements; but as the traveller, aware of his danger,
commonly puts his "bag of needments" or valuables
under his head, it does sometimes happen that the
deftest thief will rouse him by withdrawing it. If one
of our two wayfarers was thus aroused, he would call
on his comrade for help, and between them the thief
would stand a poor chance; but the solitary traveller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
suddenly roused from sleep, with no helper at hand,
might very easily stand a worse chance than the thief.
The fourth illustration (ver. 12) is that of the threefold
cord&mdash;three strands twisted into one, which, as we all
know, English no less than Hebrew, is much more
than three times as strong as any one of the separate
strands.</p>

<p>But in the fifth and most elaborate illustration (vv.
13, 14), we are once more carried back to the East.
The slightest acquaintance with Oriental history will
teach us how uncertain is the tenure of royal power;
how often it has happened that a prisoner has been led
from a dungeon to a throne, and a prince suddenly
deposed and reduced to impotence and penury. Coheleth
supposes such a case. On the one hand, we
have a king old, but not venerable, since, long as he
has lived, he has not "even yet learned to accept
admonition;" he has led a solitary, selfish, suspicious
life, secluded himself in his harem, surrounded himself
with a troop of flattering courtiers and slaves. On the
other hand, we have the poor but wise young man,
"the affable youth," who has lived with all sorts and
conditions of men, acquainted himself with their habits
and wants and desires, and conciliated their regard.
His growing popularity alarms the old despot and his
minions. He is cast into prison. His wrongs and sufferings
endear him to the wronged and suffering people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
By a sudden outbreak of popular wrath, by a revolution
such as often sweeps through Eastern states, he is set
free, and led from the prison to the throne, although
he was once so poor that none would do him reverence.
This is the picture in the mind's eye of the Preacher;
and, as he contemplates it, he rises into a kind of
prophetic rapture, and cries, "I see&mdash;I see all the
living who walk under the sun flocking to the youth
who stands up in the old king's stead; there is no
end to the multitude of the people over whom he
ruleth!" (ver. 15).</p>

<p>By these graphic illustrations Coheleth sets forth
the superiority of the sociable over the solitary and
selfish temper, of union over isolation, of the neighbourly
goodwill which leads men to combine for
common ends over the jealous rivalry which prompts
them to take advantage of each other, and to labour
each for himself alone.</p>

<p>But even as he urges this better, happier temper on
men occupied with business and public affairs, even
as he contemplates its brightest illustration in the
youthful prisoner whose winning and sociable qualities
have lifted him to a throne, the old mood of melancholy
comes back on him; there is the familiar
pathetic break in his voice as he concludes (ver. 16),
that even this wise youth, who wins all hearts for a
time, will soon be forgotten; that "even this," for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
so hopeful as it looks, "is vanity and vexation of
spirit."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A profound gloom rests on the second act of this
Drama. It has already taught us that we are helpless
in the grip of laws which we had no voice in making;
that we often lie at the mercy of men whose mercy is
but a caprice; that in our origin and end, in body
and spirit, in faculty and prospect, in our lives and
pleasures, we are no better than the beasts which perish:
that the avocations into which we plunge, and amid
which we seek to forget our sad estate, spring from
our jealousy the one of the other, and tend to a lonely
miserliness without use or charm. The Preacher's
familiar conclusion&mdash;"Be tranquil, be content, enjoy as
much as you can"&mdash;has grown doubtful to him. He
has seen the brightest promise come to nought. In
a new and profounder sense, "all is vanity and vexation
of spirit."</p>

<p>But, though passing through a great darkness, he
sees, and reflects, some little light. Even when facts
seem to contradict it, he holds fast to the conclusion
that wisdom is better than folly, and kindness better
than selfishness, and to do good even though you lose
by it better than to do evil and gain by it. His faith
wavers only for a moment; it never wholly loosens
its hold. And, in the fifth chapter, the light grows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
though even here the darkness does not altogether
disappear. We are sensible that the twilight in
which we stand is not that of evening, which will
deepen into night, but that of morning, which will
shine more and more until the day dawn, and the
daystar arise in the calm heaven of patient tranquil
hearts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>So also a
happier and
more effective
Method of
Worship is
open to Men</i>;
Ch. v., vv. 1-7.</div>

<p>The men of affairs are led from the vocations of the
Market and the intrigues of the Divan into the House
of God. Our first glance at the worshippers
is not hopeful or inspiriting.
For here are men who offer sacrifices
in lieu of obedience; and here are men
whose prayers are a voluble repetition of
phrases which run far in advance of their
limping thoughts and desires: and there are men quick
to make vows in moments of peril, but slow to redeem
them when the peril is past. At first the House of
God looks very like a House of Merchandise, in which
brokers and traders drive a traffic as dishonest as any
that disgraces the Exchange. But while the merchants
and politicians stand criticising the conduct of the
worshippers, the Preacher turns upon them and shows
them that <i>they</i> are the worshippers whom they criticise;
that he has held up a glass in which they see themselves
as others see them; that it is <i>they</i> who vow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
do not pay, <i>they</i> who hurry on their mouths to utter
words which their hearts do not prompt, <i>they</i> who take
the roundabout course of sinning and sacrificing for sin
instead of that plain road of obedience which leads
straight to God.</p>

<p>But what comfort for them is there in that? How
should it help them, to be beguiled into condemning
themselves? Truly there would not be much comfort
in it did not the compassionate Preacher forthwith disclose
the secret of this dishonest worship, and give
them counsels of amendment. He discloses the secret in
two verses (vv. 3 and 7), which have much perplexed
the readers of this Book. He there explains that just
as a mind harassed by much occupation and the many
cares it breeds cannot rest even at nights, but busies
itself in framing wild disturbing dreams, so also is it
with the foolish worshipper who, for want of thought
and reverence, pours out before God a multitude of
unsifted and unconsidered wishes in a multitude of
words. In effect he says to them: "You men of affairs
often get little help or comfort from the worship of
God because you come to it with preoccupied hearts,
just as a man gets little comfort from his bed because
his brain, jaded and yet excited by many cares, will
not suffer him to rest. Hence it is that you promise
more than you perform, and utter prayers more devout
than any honest expression of your desires would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
warrant, and offer sacrifices to avoid the charge and
trouble of obedience to the Divine laws. And as I
have shown you a more excellent way of transacting
business than the selfish grasping mode to which you
are addicted, so also I will show you a more excellent
style of worship. Go to the House of God 'with a
straight foot,' a foot trained to walk in the path of
obedience. Keep your heart, set a watch over it, lest
it should be diverted from the simple and devout
homage it should pay. Do not urge and press it to
a false emotion, to a strained and insincere mood.
Let your words be few and reverent when you speak
to the Great King. Do not vow except under the
compulsion of stedfast resolves, and pay your vows
even to your own hurt when once they are made. Do
not anger God, or the angel of God who, as you
believe, presides over the altar, with idle unreal talk
and idle half-meant resolves, making vows of which
you afterwards repent and do not keep, pleading that
you made them in error or infirmity. But in all the
exercises of your worship show a holy fear of the
Almighty; and then, under the worst oppressions of
fortune and the heaviest calamities of time, you shall
find the House of God <i>a Sanctuary</i>, and his worship a
strength, a consolation, and a delight." This, surely,
was very wholesome counsel for men of business in
hard times.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And a more
helpful and
consolatory
Trust in the
Divine Providence.</i>
Ch. v., vv. 8-17.</div>

<p>Not content with this, however, the Preacher goes
on to show how, when they returned from the House
of God to the common round of life, and
were once more exposed to its miseries
and distractions, there were certain comfortable
and sustaining thoughts on which
they might stay their spirits. To the
worship of the Sanctuary he would have
them add a strengthening trust in the Providence of
God. That Providence was expressed, as in other
ordinances, so also in these two:&mdash;</p>

<p>First; whatever oppressions and perversions of
justice and equity there were in the land (ver. 8), still
the judges and satraps who oppressed them were not
supreme; there was an official hierarchy in which
superior watched over superior, and if justice were
not to be had of the one, it might be had of another
who was above him; if it were not to be had of any,
no, not even of the king himself, there was this
reassuring conviction that, in the last resort, even the
king was "the servant of the field" (ver. 9), <i>i.e.</i>, was
dependent on the wealth and produce of the land, and
could not, therefore, be unjust with impunity, or push
his oppressions too far lest he should decrease his
revenue or depopulate his realm. This was "the
advantage" the people had; and if it were in itself but
a slight advantage to this man or that, clearly it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a great advantage to the body politic; while as an
indication of the Providence of God, of the care with
which He had arranged for the general well-being, it
was full of consolation.</p>

<p>The second fact, or class of facts, in which they
might recognise the gracious care of God was this,&mdash;That
the unjust judges and wealthy rapacious "lords"
who oppressed them had very much less satisfaction
in their fraudulent gains than they might suppose.
God had so made men that injustice and selfishness
defeated their own ends, and those who lived for
wealth, and would do evil to acquire it, made but a
poor bargain after all. "He that <i>loveth</i> silver is
never satisfied with silver, nor he that <i>clings</i> to wealth
with what it yields" (ver. 10). "When riches increase,
they increase that consume them"&mdash;dependents,
parasites, slaves, flock around the man who rises to
wealth and place. He cannot eat and drink more, or
enjoy more, than when he was a man simply well-to-do
in the world; the only advantage he has is that
he sees others consume what he has acquired at so
great a cost (ver. 11).<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He cannot know the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
refreshing sleep of husbandmen weary with toil (ver.
12), for his heart is full of care and apprehension.
Robbers may drive off his flocks, or "lift" his cattle;
his investments may fail, or his secret hoard be plundered;
he must trust much to servants, and they
may be unfaithful to their trust; his official superiors
may ruin him with the bribes they extort, or the
prince himself may want a sponge to squeeze. If
none of these evils befall him, he may apprehend,
and have cause to apprehend, that his heir longs for
his death, and will prove little better than a fool,
wasting in wanton riot what <i>he</i> has amassed with
much painful toil (vv. 13, 14). And, in any event,
he cannot take his wealth with him on his last journey
(vv. 15, 16). So that, naturally enough, he is much
perturbed, and "hath great vexation and grief" (ver.
17), cannot sleep for his apprehensive care for his
"abundance;" and at last must go out of the world as
bare and unprovided as he came into it.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He "labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
for the wind," and reaps what he has sown. Was
such a life, mounting to such a close, a thing to long
for and toil for? Was it worth while to hurl oneself
against the adamantine laws of Heaven and risk the
oppressions of earth, to injure one's neighbours, to
sink into an insincere and distracted worship and a
weakening distrust of the providence of God, in
order to spend anxious toilsome days and sleepless
nights, and at last to go out of the world naked of
all but guilt, and rich in nothing but the memory of
frauds and wrongs? Might not even a captive or a
slave, whose sleep was sweetened by toil, and who,
from his trust in God and the sacred delights of
honest worship, gathered strength to endure all the
oppressions of the time, and to enjoy whatever alleviations
and innocent pleasures were vouchsafed him&mdash;might
not even he be a wiser, happier man than the
despot at whose caprice he stood?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Conclusion.</i>
Ch. v., vv. 18-20.</div>

<p>For himself Coheleth has a very decided opinion
on this point. He is quite sure that
his first conclusion is sound, though for
a moment he had questioned its soundness, and that
a quiet, cheerful, and obedient heart is greater riches
than the wealthiest estate. With all the emphasis of
renewed and now immovable conviction he declares,</p>

<p>Behold, that which I have said holds good; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
well for a man to eat and to drink, and to enjoy
the good of all his labours through the brief day of
his life. And I have also said&mdash;and this too is true&mdash;that
a man to whom God hath given riches and
wealth&mdash;for even a rich man may be a good man
and use his wealth wisely&mdash;if He hath also enabled
him to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to
rejoice in his labour&mdash;this too is a most Divine gift.
He does not fret over the brevity of his life; it is not
much, or often, or sadly in his thoughts: for he knows
that the joy his heart takes in the toils and pleasures
of life is approved by God, or even, as the phrase
seems to mean, corresponds in some measure with the
joy of God Himself; that his tranquil enjoyment is a
reflection of the Divine peace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>II.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> There are not many Englishmen who devote
themselves solely or mainly to the acquisition of
Wisdom, and who, that they may teach the children
of men that which is good, live laborious days, withdrawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
from the general pursuit of wealth and scorning
the lures of ease and self-indulgence; such men, indeed,
are but a small minority in any age or land.
Nor do those who give themselves exclusively to the
pursuit of Pleasure constitute more than a small and
miserable class, though most of us have wasted on it
days that we could ill spare. But when the Hebrew
Preacher, having followed his quest of the supreme
Good in Pleasure and Wisdom, turns to the affairs of
Business&mdash;and I use that term as including both
commerce and politics&mdash;he enters a field of action and
inquiry with which we are nearly all familiar, and can
hardly fail to speak words which will touch us close
home. For, whatever else we may or may not be, we
are most of us among the worshippers of the great god
Traffic&mdash;a god whose wholesome, benignant face too
often lowers and darkens, or ever we are aware, into
the sordid and malignant features of Mammon.</p>

<p>Now in dealing with this broad and momentous province
of human life the Preacher exhibits the candour
and the temperance which marked his treatment of
Wisdom and Mirth. Just as he would not suffer us to
think of Wisdom as in itself an evil, nor of Pleasure
as an evil, so neither will he allow us to think of
Business as essentially and of necessity an evil. This,
like those, may be abused to our hurt; but none the
less they may all be used, and were meant to be used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
for our own and our neighbours' good. Pursued in
the right method, from the right motive, with the due
moderation and reserve, Business, as he is careful to
point out, besides bringing other great advantages,
may be a new bond of union and brotherhood: it
develops intercourse among men and races of men, and
should develop sympathy, goodwill, and a mutual
helpfulness. Nevertheless, thrift may degenerate into
miserliness, and the honest industry of content into a
dishonest eagerness for undue gains, and a wise attention
to business into an excessive devotion to it. These
degenerate tendencies had struck their roots deep into
the Hebrew mind of his day, and brought forth many
bitter fruits. The Preacher describes and denounces
them; he lays an axe to the very roots of these evil
growths: but it is only that he may clear a space for
the fairer and more wholesome growths which sprang
beside them, and of which they were the wild bastard
offshoots.</p>

<p>Throughout this second section of the Book, his subject
is excessive devotion to Business, and the correctives
to it which his experience enables him to suggest.</p>

<p>1. His handling of the subject is very thorough and
complete. Men of business might do worse than get
the lessons he here teaches by heart. According to
him, their excessive devotion to affairs springs from a
"jealous rivalry"; it tends to form in them a grasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
covetous temper which can never be satisfied, to produce
a materialistic scepticism of all that is noble,
spiritual, aspiring in thought and action, to render
their worship formal and insincere, and, in general, to
incapacitate them for any quiet happy enjoyment of
their life. This is his diagnosis of their disease, or of
that diseased tendency which, if it be for the most part
latent in them, always threatens to become pronounced
and to infect all healthy conditions of the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Devotion to
Business
springs from
Jealous Competition</i>:
Ch. iv., v. 4.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Let us glance once more at the several symptoms
we have already heard him discuss, and consider whether
or not they accord with the results of our
own observation and experience. Is it
true, then&mdash;or, rather, is it not true&mdash;that
our devotion to business is becoming
excessive and exhausting, and that this
devotion springs mainly from our jealous rivalry and
competition with each other? If, some two or three
and twenty centuries ago, the Jews were bent every
man on outdoing and outselling his neighbour; if his
main ambition was to amass greater wealth or to secure
a larger business than his competitors, or to make a
handsomer show before the world; if in the urgent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
pursuit of this ambition he held his neighbours not as
neighbours, but as unscrupulous rivals, keen for gain at
his expense and to rise by his fall; if, to reach his end,
he was willing to get up early and go late to rest, to
force all his energies into an injurious activity and
strain them close to the snapping-point: if this were
what a Jew of that time was like, might you not
easily take it for a portrait of many an English merchant,
manufacturer, lawyer, or politician? Is it not
as accurate a delineation of our life as it could be of
any ancient form of life? If it be, as I think it is, we
have grave need to take the Preacher's warning. We
gravely need to remember that the stream cannot rise
above its source, nor the fruit be better than the root
from which it grows; that the business ardour which
has its origin in a base and selfish motive can only be
a base and selfish ardour. When men gather grapes
from thorns and figs from thistles, then, but not before,
we may look to find a satisfying good in "all the toil
and all the dexterity in toil" which spring from this
"jealous rivalry of the one with the other."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>It tends to form
a Covetous
Temper</i>:
Ch. iv., v. 8.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Nor, in the face of facts patent to the most cursory
observer, can we deny that this eager and excessive
devotion to the successful conduct of
business tends to produce a grasping,
covetous temper which, however much it
has gained, is for ever seeking more. It is not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
true that the stream cannot rise above its source; it is
also true that the stream <i>will</i> run downward, and must
inevitably contract many pollutions from the lower levels
on which it declines. The ardour which impels men to
devote themselves with eager intensity to the labours of
the Market may often have an origin as pure as that
of the stream which bubbles up on the hills, amid grass
and ferns, and runs tinkling along its clear rocky
channels, setting its labour to a happy music, singing
its low sweet song to the sweet listening air. But as
it runs on, if it swell in volume and power, it also <i>sinks</i>
and grows foul. Bent at first on acquiring the means
to support a widowed mother, or to justify him in
taking a wife, or to provide for his children, or to win
an honourable place in his neighbours' eyes, or to
achieve the chance of self-culture and self-development,
or to serve some public and worthy end, the man of
business and affairs too often suffers himself to become
more and more absorbed in his pursuits. He conceives
larger schemes, is drawn into more perilous enterprises,
and advances through these to fresh openings and
opportunities, until at last, long after his original ends
are compassed and forgotten, he finds himself possessed
by the mere craving to extend his labours, resources,
influence, if not by the mere craving to amass&mdash;a craving
which often "teareth" and "tormenteth" him, but
which can only be exorcised by an exertion of spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
force which would leave him half dead. "He has no
one with him, not even a son or a brother;" the dear
mother or wife is long since dead; his children, to use
his own detestable phrase, are "off his hands"; the
public good has slipped from his memory and aims:
but still "there is no end to all his labours, neither
are his eyes satisfied with riches." Coheleth speaks
of one such man: alas, of how many such might we
speak!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To produce a
Materialistic
Scepticism</i>;
Ch. iii.,
vv. 18-21.</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The "speculation" in the eye of business men is
not commonly of a philosophic cast, and therefore we
do not look to find them <i>arguing</i> themselves
into the materialism which infected
the Hebrew Preacher as he contemplated
them and their blind devotion to their
idol. They are far, perhaps very far, from thinking
that in body and spirit, in origin and end, man is no
better than the beast, a creature of the same accident
and subject to "the same chance." But though they
do not reason out a conclusion so sombre and depressing,
do they not practically acquiesce in it? If it is
far from their thoughts, do they not <i>live</i> in its close
neighbourhood? Their mind, like the dyer's hand, is
subdued to that it works in. Accustomed to think
mainly of material interests, their character is materialised.
They are disposed to weigh all things&mdash;truth,
righteousness, the motives and aims of nobler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
men&mdash;in the scales of the market, and can very hardly
believe that they should attach any grave value to ought
which will not lend itself to their coarse handling. In
their judgment, mental culture, or the graces of moral
character, or single-hearted devotion to lofty ends, are
not worthy to be compared with a full purse or large
possessions. They regard as little better than a fool,
of whom it is very kind of them to take a little care,
the man who has thrown away what they call "his
chances," in order that he may learn wisdom or do
good. Giving, perhaps, a cheerful and unforced accord
to the current moral maxims and popular creed, they
permit neither to rule their conduct. If they do not
say, "Man is no better than a beast," they carry themselves
as if he were no better, as though he had no
instincts or interests above those of the thrifty ant,
or the cunning beaver, or the military locust, or
insatiable leech&mdash;although they are both surprised and
affronted when one is at the pains to translate their
deeds into words. Judged by their deeds, they <i>are</i>
sceptics and materialists, since they have no vital faith
in that which is spiritual and unseen. They have
found "the life of their hands," and they are content
with it. Give them whatever furnishes the senses,
whatever in them holds by sense, and they will
cheerfully let all else go. But such a materialism as
this is far more injurious, far more likely to be fatal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
than that which reflects, and argues, and utters itself
in words, and refutes itself by the very powers which
it employs. With them the malady has struck inward,
and is beyond the reach of cure save by the most
searching and drastic remedies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To make Worship
Formal
and Insincere</i>;
Ch. v., vv. 1-7.</div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) But now if, like Coheleth, we follow these men
to the Temple, what is the scene that meets our eye?
In the English Temple, I fear, that which
would first strike an unaccustomed observer
would be the fact that very few
men of business are there. They are "conspicuous
by their absence," or, at best, noted for an only occasional
attendance. The Hebrew Temple was crowded
with men; in the English Temple it is the other sex
which predominates. But glance at the men who are
there? Do you detect no signs of weariness and
perfunctoriness? Do you hear no vows which will
never be paid, and which they do not intend to pay even
when they make them? no prayers which go beyond
any honest and candid expression of their desires?
Do you not feel and know that many of them are
making an unwilling sacrifice to the decencies and the
proprieties, instead of worshipping God the Spirit in
spirit and nerving themselves for the difficulties of
obedience to the Divine law? Listen: they are saying,
"Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we bless Thee
for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
this life; but <i>above all</i> for Thine inestimable love in the
redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, for
the means of grace, and for the hope of glory." But
<i>are</i> these ineffable spiritual benefits "above all" else to
them? Do they care for "the means of grace" as much
even as for the state of the market, or for "the hope of
glory" as much as for success or promotion? Which
is most in their thoughts, their lives, their aspirations,
for which will they take most pains and make most
sacrifices&mdash;for what <i>they</i> mean by the beautiful phrase
"all the blessings of this life," or for that sacred and
crowning act of the Divine Mercy, "the redemption,"
in which God has once for all revealed his fatherly
forgiving love?</p>

<p>What is it that makes their worship formal and
insincere? It is the very cause which, as the Preacher
tells us, produced the like evil effect upon the Jews.
They come into the Temple with pre-occupied hearts.
Their thoughts are distracted by the cares of life
even as they bend in worship. And hence even the
most sacred words turn to "idle talk" on their lips,
as remote from the true feeling of the moment as
"the multitude of dreams" which haunt the night;
they utter fervent prayers without any due sense of
their meaning, or any hearty wish to have them
granted.</p>

with temptations, should have a very large and certain
reward to offer. But has it? For one,
Coheleth thinks it has not. In his
judgment, according to his experience,
instead of making a man happier even in
this present time, to which it limits his
thoughts and aims, it robs him of all quiet and happy
enjoyment of his life. And, mark, it is not the unsuccessful
man of business, who might naturally feel sore
and aggrieved, but the successful man, the man who
has made a fortune and prospered in his schemes,
whom the Preacher describes as having lost all faculty
of enjoying his gains. Even the man who has wealth
and abundance, so that his soul lacketh nothing of all
that he desireth, is placed before us as the slave of
unsatisfied desire and constant apprehension. Both
his hands are so full of labour that he cannot lay hold
on quiet. Though he loves silver so well, and has so
much of it, he is not satisfied therewith; his riches
yield him no certain and abiding delight. And how
can he be in "happy plight" who is</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">"debarred the benefit of rest?</span>
<span class="i0">When day's oppression is not eased by night,</span>
<span class="i0">But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?</span>
<span class="i0">And each, though enemies to either's reign,</span>

</div>

<p>The sound sleep of humble contented labour is denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
him. He is haunted by perpetual apprehensions that
"there is some ill a-brewing to his rest," that evil in
some dreaded shape will befall him. He doubts "the
filching age will steal his treasure." He knows that
when he is called hence he can carry away nothing in
his hand; all his gains must be left to his heir, who
may either turn out a wanton fool or be crushed and
degraded by the burden and temptations of a wealth
for which he has not laboured. And hence, amid all
his toils and gains, even the most prosperous and
successful man suspects that he has been "labouring
for the wind" and may reap the whirlwind:
"he is much perturbed, and hath vexation and
grief."</p>

<p><i>Is</i> the picture overdrawn? Is not the description
as true to modern experience as to that of "the
antique world"? Shakespeare, who is our great English
authority on the facts of human experience, thought it
quite as true. His Merchant of Venice has argosies
on every sea; and two of his friends, hearing him
confess that sadness makes such a want-wit of him
that he has much ado to know himself, tell him that his
"mind is tossing on the ocean" with his ships. They
proceed to discuss the natural effects of having so
many enterprises on hand. One says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i1">"Believe me, Sir, had I such venture forth,</span>

<p>And the other adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">"My wind, cooling my broth,</span>
<span class="i0">Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</span>

<span class="i0">To think on this; and shall I lack the thought</span>
<span class="i0">That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?"</span>
</div>

<p>"Abundance suffereth not the rich to sleep;" the
thought that his "riches may perish in some unlucky
adventure" rings a perpetual alarum in his ears: "all
his days he eateth in darkness, and is much perturbed,
and hath vexation and grief." These are the words
of the Hebrew Preacher: are not our own great poet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
words an expressive commentary on them, an absolute
confirmation of them, covering them point by point?
And shall we envy the wealthy merchant whose two
hands are thus "full of labour and vexation of spirit"?
Is not "the husbandman whose sleep is sweet, whether
he eat little or much," better off than he? Nay, has
not even the sluggard who, so long as he hath meat,
foldeth his hands in quiet, a truer enjoyment of his
life?</p>

<p>Of course Coheleth does not mean to imply that
every man of business degenerates into a miserly
sceptic, whose worship is a formulated hypocrisy and
whose life is haunted with saddening apprehensions of
misfortune. No doubt there were then, as there are
now, many men of business who were wise enough to
"take pleasure in all their labours," to cast their burden
of care on Him in whose care stand both to-morrow
and to-day; men to whom worship was a calming and
strengthening communion with the Father of their
spirits, and who advanced, through toil, to worthy or
even noble ends. He means simply that these are the
perils to which all men of business are exposed, and
into which they fall so soon as their devotion to its
affairs grows excessive. "Make business, and success
in business, your chief good, your ruling aim, and you
will come to think of your neighbours as selfish rivals;
you will begin to look askance on the lofty spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
qualities which refuse to bow to the yoke of Mammon;
your worship will sink into an insincere formalism; your
life will be vexed and saddened with fears which will
strangle the very faculty of tranquil enjoyment:" this
is the warning of the Preacher; a warning of which
our generation, in such urgent sinful haste to be rich,
stands in very special need.</p>

<p>2. But what checks, what correctives, what remedies,
would the Preacher have us apply to the diseased
tendencies of the time? How shall men of business
save themselves from being absorbed in its interests
and affairs?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Correctives
of this
Devotion are a
Sense of its
Perils</i>;
Ch. v., vv.
10-17.</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Well, the very sense of the danger to which they
are exposed&mdash;a danger so insidious, so profound, so
fatal&mdash;should surely induce caution and a
wary self-control. The symptoms of the
disease are described that we may judge
whether or not we are infected by it; its
dreadful issues that, if infected, we may
study a cure. The man who loves
riches is placed before us that we may learn what he
is really like&mdash;that he is not the careless happy being
we often assume him to be. We see him decline
on the low bare levels of covetousness and materialism,
hypocrisy and fear; and, as we look, the
Preacher turns upon us with, "There, <i>that</i> is the slave
of Mammon in his habit as he lives. Do you care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to be like that? Will you break your heart unless
you are allowed to assume his heavy and degrading
burden?"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And the Conviction
that it
is opposed to
the Will of
God as expressed
in the
Ordinances of
his Providence</i>,
Ch. iii., vv. 1-8.</div>

<p>This is one help to a wise content with our lot; but
he has many more at our service, and notably this,&mdash;that
an undue devotion to the toils of
business is contrary to the will, the
design, the providence of God. God, he
argues, has fixed a time for every undertaking
under heaven, and has made each
of them beautiful in its season, but only
then. By his wise kindly ordinances He
has sought to divert us from an injurious excess in toil.
Our sowing and our reaping, our time of rest and our
time for work, the time to save and the time to spend,
the time to gain and the time to lose,&mdash;all these, with
all the fluctuating feelings they excite in us: in short,
our whole life, from the cradle to the grave, is under,
or should be under, law to Him. It is only when we
violate his gracious ordinances,&mdash;working when we
should be at rest, waking when we should sleep, saving
when we should spend, weeping over losses which are
real gains, or laughing over gains which will prove to
be losses&mdash;that we run into excess, and break up the
peaceful order and tranquil flow of the life which He
designed for us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>In the Wrongs
which He permits
Men to
inflict upon us</i>;
Ch. iii., v. 16-Ch.
iv., v. 3.</div>

<p>Because we will not be obsequious to the ordinances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of his wisdom, He permits us to meet a new check in
the caprice and injustice of man&mdash;making
even these to praise Him by subserving
our good. If we do not suffer the violent
oppressions which drew tears from the
Preacher's fellow-captives, we nevertheless
stand very much at the mercy of our neighbours in
so far as our outward haps are concerned. Unwise
human laws or an unjust administration of them, or the
selfish rapacity of individual men&mdash;brokers who rig the
market; bankers whose long prayers are a pretence
under cloak of which they rob widows and orphans,
and sometimes <i>make</i> them; bankrupts for whose
wounds the Gazette has a singular power of healing,
since they come out of it "sounder" men than they
went in: these are only some of the instruments by
which the labours of the diligent are shorn of their
due reward. And we are to take these checks as
correctives, to find in the losses which men inflict the
gifts of a gracious God. He permits us to suffer
these and the like disasters lest our hearts should be
overmuch set on getting gain. He graciously permits
us to suffer them that, seeing how often the wicked
thrive (in a way and for a time) on the decay of the
upright, we may learn that there is something better
than wealth, more enduring, more satisfying, and may
seek that higher good.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>But above all,
in the immortal
Cravings
which He has
quickened in
the Soul.</i>
Ch. iii., v. 11.</div>

<p>Nay, going to the very root of the matter and
expounding its whole philosophy, the Preacher teaches
us that wealth, however great and greatly
used, <i>cannot</i> satisfy men, since God has
"<i>put eternity into their hearts</i>" as well as
time: and how should all the kingdoms
of a world that must soon pass content
those who are to live for ever?<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This saying, "God
has put <i>eternity</i> into their hearts," is one of the most
profound in the whole Book, and one of the most beautiful
and suggestive. What it means is that, even if a man
would confine his aims and desires within "the bounds
and coasts of Time," he cannot do it. The very
structure of his nature forbids it. For time, with all
that it inherits, sweeps by him like a torrent, so that,
if he would secure any lasting good, he <i>must</i> lay hold
of that which is eternal. We may well call this world,
for all so solid as it looks, "a perishing world;" for,
like our own bodies, it is in a perpetual flux, perishing
every moment that it may live a little longer, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
soon come to an end. But we, in our true selves, we
who dwell inside the body and use its members as the
workman uses his tools, how can we find a satisfying
good whether in the body or in the world which is akin to
it? <i>We</i> want a good as lasting as ourselves. Nothing
short of that can be our chief good, or inspire us with
a true content.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,</span>

</div>

<p>and we might as well think to build a stable habitation
on the waves which break upon the pebbled shore as
to find an enduring good in the sequent minutes which
carry us down the stream of time. It is only because
we do not understand this "work of God" in putting
eternity into our hearts and therefore making it impossible
for us to be content with anything less than
an eternal good; it is because, plunged in the flesh and
its cares and delights, we forget the grandeur of our
nature, and are tempted to sell our immortal birthright
for a mess of pottage which, however much we enjoy
it to-day, will leave us hungry to-morrow: it is only, I
say, because we fail to understand this work of God
"from beginning to end," that we ever delude ourselves
with the hope of finding in ought the earth yields a
good in which we can rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Practical
Maxims deduced
from this
View of the
Business-life.</i></div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A noble philosophy this, and pregnant with
practical counsels of great value. For if,
as we close our study of this Section of
the Book, we ask, "What good advice
does the Preacher offer that we can take
and act upon?" we shall find that he gives us at least
three serviceable maxims.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Maxim on
Co-operation.</i>
Ch. iv., vv.
9-16.</div>

<p>To all men of business conscious of their special
dangers and anxious to avoid them, he says, first:
Replace the competition which springs
from your jealous and selfish rivalry, with
the co-operation which is born of sympathy
and breeds goodwill. "Two are better than one.
Union is better than isolation. Conjoint labour has
the greater reward." Instead of seeking to take advantage
of your neighbours, try to help them. Instead
of standing alone, associate with your fellows. Instead
of aiming at purely selfish ends, pursue your ends in
common. Indeed the wise Hebrew Preacher anticipates
the golden rule to a remarkable extent, and, in effect,
bids us love our neighbour as ourself, look on his
things as well as our own, and do to all men as we
would that they should do to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Maxim on
Worship.</i>
Ch. v., vv. 1-7.</div>

<p>His second maxim is: Replace the formality of your
worship with a reverent and steadfast
sincerity. Keep your foot when you go
to the House of God. Put obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
before sacrifice. Do not hurry on your mouth to the
utterance of words which transcend the desires of
your heart. Be not of those who</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">"words for virtue take,</span>
<span class="i0">As though mere wood a shrine would make."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Do not come into the Temple with a pre-occupied
spirit, a spirit distracted with thoughts that travel
different ways. Realise the presence of the Great
King, and speak to Him with the reverence due to a
King. Keep the vows you have made in his House
after you have left it. Seek and serve Him with all
your hearts, and ye shall find rest to your souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Maxim on
Trust in God.</i>
Ch. v., vv. 8-17.</div>

<p>And his last maxim is: Replace your grasping self-sufficiency
with a constant trust in the fatherly providence
of God. If you see oppression or
suffer wrong, if your schemes are thwarted
and your enterprises fail, you need not
therefore lose the quiet repose and settled peace which
spring from a sense of duty discharged and the undisturbed
possession of the main good of life. God
is over all, and rules all the undertakings of man,
giving each its season and place, and causing all to
work together for the good of the loving and trustful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
heart. Trust in Him, and you shall feel, even though
you cannot prove,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"That every cloud that spreads above,</span>
<span class="i0">And veileth love, itself is love."</span>
</div>

<p>Trust in Him, and you shall find that</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The slow sweet hours that bring us all things good,</span>
<span class="i0">The slow sad hours that bring us all things ill</span>
<span class="i0">And all good things from evil,"</span>
</div>

<p>as they strike on the great horologe of Time, are set
to a growing music by the hand of God; a music
which rises and falls as we listen, but which nevertheless
swells through all its saddest cadences and dying
falls toward that harmonious close, that "undisturbed
concent," in which all discords will be drowned.</p>

<h2>THIRD SECTION.</h2>

<h3><i>THE QUEST OF THE CHIEF GOOD IN WEALTH,
AND IN THE GOLDEN MEAN.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chaps. VI., VII., and VIII., vv. 1-15.</span></p>


<p>In the foregoing Section Coheleth has shown that
the Chief Good is not to be found in that Devotion
to the affairs of Business which was, and still is, characteristic
of the Hebrew race. This devotion is
commonly inspired either by the desire to amass great
wealth, for the sake of the status, influence, and means
of lavish enjoyment it is assumed to confer; or by the
more modest desire to secure a competence, to stand
in that golden mean of comfort which is darkened by
no harassing fears of future penury or need. By a
logical sequence of thought, therefore, he advances
from his discussion on Devotion to Business, to consider
the leading motives by which it is inspired. The
questions he now asks and answers are, in effect,
(1) Will Wealth confer the good, the tranquil and
enduring satisfaction which men seek? And if not, (2)
Will that moderate provision for the present and for
the future to which the more prudent restrict their aim?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
Wealth.</i>
Ch. vi.</div>

<p>His discussion of the first of these questions,
although very matterful, is comparatively brief; in part,
perhaps, because in the previous Section
he has already dwelt on many of the
drawbacks which accompany wealth; and
still more, probably, because, while there are but few
men in any age to whom great wealth is possible, there
would be unusually few in the company of poor men
for whose instruction he wrote. Brief and simple as
the discussion is, however, we shall misapprehend it
unless we bear in mind that Coheleth is arguing, not
against wealth, but against mistaking wealth for the
Chief Good.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Man who
makes Riches
his Chief Good
is haunted by
Fears and Perplexities</i>:
Ch. vi., vv. 1-6.</div>

<p>Let us observe, then, that throughout this sixth
Chapter the Preacher is dealing with the <i>lover</i> of riches,
not with the rich man; that he is speaking,
not against wealth, but against mistaking
wealth for the Chief Good. The
man who <i>trusts</i> in riches is placed before
us; and, that we may see him at his best,
he has the riches in which he trusts. God has given
him "his good things," given him them to the full.
He lacks nothing that he desireth&mdash;nothing at least
that wealth can command. Yet, because he does not
accept his abundance as the gift of God, and hold the
Giver better than the gift, he cannot enjoy it. But
how do we know that he has suffered his riches to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
an undue place in his regard? We know it by this
sure token&mdash;that he cannot leave God to take care of
them, and of him. He frets about them, and about
what will become of them when he is gone. He has
no son, perchance, to inherit them, no child, only some
"stranger" whom he has adopted (ver. 2)&mdash;and almost
all childless Orientals adopt strangers to this day, as
we have found, to our cost, in India. A profound
horror at the thought of being dead to name and fame
and use through lack of heirs was, and is, very prevalent
in the East. Even faithful Abraham, when God
had promised him the supreme good, broke out with
the remonstrance, "What canst Thou give me when
I am going off childless, and have no heir but my
body-servant, Eliezer of Damascus?" Because this
feeling lay close to the Oriental heart, the Preacher is
at some pains to show what a "vanity" it is. He
argues: "Even if you should beget a hundred children,
instead of being childless; even though you should
live a thousand years, and the grave did not wait for
you instead of lying close before you: yet, so long as
you were not content to leave your riches in the hands
of God, you would fret and perplex yourself with fears.
An abortion would be better off than you, although
it cometh in nothingness and goeth in darkness; for
it would know a rest denied to you, and sink without
apprehension into the 'place' from which all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
apprehensions cannot save you (vv. 3-6). Foolish
man! it is not because you lack an heir that you are
perturbed in spirit. If you had one, you would find
some other cause for care; you would be none the
less fretted and perturbed; for you would still be
thinking of your riches rather than of the God who
gave them, and still dread the moment in which you
must part with them, in order to return to Him."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>For God has put
Eternity into
his Heart</i>;
Ch. vi., vv. 7-10.</div>

<p>From this plain practical argument Coheleth passes
to an argument of more philosophic reach. "All the
labour of this man is <i>for his mouth</i>:"
that is to say, his wealth, with all that
it commands, appeals only to sense and
appetite; it feeds "the lust of the eye, or the lust of
the flesh, or the pride of life," and therefore "his <i>soul</i>
cannot be satisfied therewith" (ver. 7). <i>That</i> craves
a higher nutriment, a more enduring good. God has
put eternity into it: and how can that which is
immortal be contented with the lucky haps and comfortable
conditions of time? Unless some immortal
provision be made for the immortal spirit, it will pine,
and protest, and crave, till all power of happily enjoying
outward good be lost. Nay, if the spirit in man be
craving and unfed, whatever his outward conditions,
or his faculty for enjoying them, he cannot be at rest.
The wise man may be able to extract from the gains
of time a pleasure denied to the fool; and the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
man, his penury preventing him from indulging passion
and appetite to satiety, may have a keener enjoyment
of them than the magnate who has tried them to the
full and has grown weary of them. In a certain sense,
as compared the one with the other, the poor man may
have an "advantage" over the rich, and the wise man
over the fool; for "it is better to enjoy the good we
have than to crave a good beyond our reach;" and
this much the wise man, or even the poor man, may
achieve. Yet, after all, what advantage have they?
The thirst of the soul is still unslaked; no sensual or
sensuous enjoyment can satisfy that. All human action
and enjoyment is under law to God. No one is so
wise, or so strong, as to contend successfully against
Him or his ordinances. And it is He who has given
men an immortal nature, with cravings that wander
through eternity; it is He who has ordained that they
shall know no rest until they rest in Him (vv. 8-10).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And much
that he gains
only feeds
Vanity</i>;
Ch. vi., v. 11.</div>

<p>Look once more at your means and possessions.
Multiply them as you will. Still there are many
reasons why if you seek your chief good
in them, they should prove vanity and
breed vexation of spirit. One is, that
beyond a certain point you can neither
use nor enjoy them. They add to your pomp. They
enable you to fill a larger place in the world's eye.
They swell and magnify the vain show in which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
walk. But, after all, they add to your discomfort
rather than your comfort. You have so much the more
to manage, and look after, and take care of: but you
yourself, instead of being better off than you were,
have only taken a heavier task on your hands. And
what advantage is there in that?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Neither can he
tell what it
will be good
for him to
have</i>,
Ch. vi., v. 12.</div>

<p>Another reason is, that it is hard, so hard as to
be impossible, for you to know "what it is good" for
you to have. That on which you have
set your heart may prove to be an evil
rather than a good when at last you get
it. The fair fruit, so pleasant and desirable
to the eye that, to posses it, you
were content to labour and deny yourself for years,
may turn to an apple of Sodom in your mouth, and
yield you, in place of sweet pulp and juice, only the
bitter ashes of disappointment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nor foresee
what will
become of his
Gains.</i>
Ch. vi., v. 12.</div>

<p>And a third reason is, that the more you acquire
the more you must dispose of when you are called
away from this life: and who can tell
what shall be after him? How are you
so to dispose of your gains as to be sure
that they will do good and not harm, and
carry comfort to the hearts of those whom you love,
and not breed envy, alienation, and strife?</p>

<p>These are the Preacher's arguments against an undue
love of riches, against making them so dear a good that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
we can neither enjoy them while we have them, nor
trust them to the disposal of God when we must leave
them behind us. Are they not sound arguments?
Should we be saddened by them, or comforted? We
can only be saddened by them if we love wealth, or
long for it, with an inordinate desire. If we can trust
in God to give us all that it will be really good for us
to have in return for our honest toil, the arguments of
the Preacher are full of comfort and hope for us, whether
we be rich or whether we be poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
the Golden
Mean.</i>
Ch. vii., viii.,
vv. 1-15.</div>

<p>There be many that say, "Who will show us any
gold?" mistaking gold for their god or good. For
though there can be few in any age to
whom great wealth is possible, there are
many who crave it and believe that to
have it is to possess the supreme felicity.
It is not only the rich who "<i>trust</i> in riches." As a
rule, perhaps, they trust in them less than the poor,
since they have tried them, and know pretty exactly
both how much, and how little, they can do. It is
those who have not tried them, and to whom poverty
brings many undeniable hardships, who are most sorely
tempted to trust in them as the sovereign remedy for
the ills of life. So that the counsels of the sixth
chapter may have a wider scope than we sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
think they have. But, whether they apply to many
or to few, there can be no doubt that the counsels of
the seventh and eighth chapters are applicable to the
vast majority of men. For here the Preacher discusses
the Golden Mean in which most of us would like to
stand. Many of us dare not ask for great wealth lest
it should prove a burden we could very hardly bear;
but we have no scruple in adopting Agur's prayer,
"Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with
food proportioned to my need: Let me have a comfortable
competence in which I shall be at an equal
remove from the temptations whether of extreme wealth
or of extreme penury."</p>

<p>Now the endeavour to secure a competence may be,
not lawful only, but most laudable; since God means
us to make the best of the capacities He has given us
and the opportunities He sends us. Nevertheless, we
may pursue this right end from a wrong motive, in
a wrong spirit. Both spirit and motive are wrong if
we pursue our competence as if it were a good so great
that we can know no content unless we attain it. For
what is it that animates such a pursuit save distrust
in the providence of God? Left in his hands, we do
not feel that we should be safe; whereas if we had our
fortune in our own hands, and were secured against
chances and changes by a few comfortable securities,
we should feel safe enough. This feeling is, surely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
very general: we are all of us in danger of slipping
into this form of unquiet distrust in the fatherly
providence of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Method of
the Man who
seeks a
Competence.</i>
Ch. vii.,
vv. 1-14.</div>

<p>Because the feeling is both general and strong, the
Hebrew Preacher addresses himself to it at some
length. His object now is to place
before us a man who does not aim at
great affluence, but, guided by prudence
and common sense, makes it his ruling
aim to stand well with his neighbours
and to lay by a moderate provision for future wants.
The Preacher opens the discussion by stating the
maxims or rules of conduct by which such an one
would be apt to guide himself. One of his first aims
would be to secure "a good name," since that would
prepossess men in his favour, and open before him
many avenues which would otherwise be closed.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Just as one entering a crowded Oriental room with
some choice fragrance exhaling from person and apparel
would find bright faces turned toward him, and a ready
way opened for his approach, so the bearer of a good
name would find many willing to meet him, and traffic
with him, and heed him. As the years passed, his good
name, if he kept it, would diffuse itself over a wider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
area with a more pungent effect, so that the day of his
death would be better than the his birth&mdash;to
leave a good name being so much more honourable
than to inherit one (chap. vii., ver. 1).</p>

<p>But how would he go about to acquire his good
name? Again the answer carries us back to the East.
Nothing is more striking to a Western traveller than
the dignified gravity of the superior Oriental races.
In public they rarely smile, almost never laugh, and
hardly ever express surprise. Cool, courteous, self-possessed,
they bear good news or bad, prosperous or
adverse fortune, with a proud equanimity. This equal
mind, expressing itself in a grave dignified bearing,
is, with them, well-nigh indispensable to success in
public life. And, therefore, our friend in quest of a
good name betakes himself to the house of mourning
rather than to the house of feasting; he holds that
serious thought on the end of all men is better than the
wanton foolish mirth which crackles like thorns under
a kettle, making a great sputter, but soon going out;
and would rather have his heart bettered by the reproof
of the wise than listen to the song of fools over the
wine-cup (vv. 2-6). Knowing that he cannot be
much with fools without sharing their folly, fearing
that they may lead him into those excesses in which
the wisest mind is infatuated and the kindest heart
hardened and corrupted (ver. 7), he elects rather to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
walk with a sad countenance, among the wise, to the
house of mourning and meditation, than to hurry with
fools to the banquet in which wine and song and
laughter drown serious reflection, and leave the heart
worse than they found it. What though the wise
reprove him when he errs? What though, as he
listens to their reproof, his heart at times grows hot
within him? The end of their reproof is better than
the beginning (ver. 8); as he reflects upon it, he learns
from it, profits by it, and by patient endurance of it
wins a good from it which haughty resentment would
have cast away. Unlike the fools, therefore, whose
wanton mirth turns into bitter anger at the mere sound
of reproof, he will not suffer his spirit to be hurried
into a hot resentment, but will compel that which
injures them to do him good (ver. 9). Nor will he
rail even at the fools who fleet the passing hour, or
account that, because they are so many and so bold,
"the time is out of joint." He will show himself not
only wiser than the foolish, but wiser than many of
the wise; for while they&mdash;and here surely the Preacher
hits a very common habit of the studious life&mdash;are
disposed to look fondly back on some past age as
greater or happier than that in which they live, and
ask, "How is it that former days were better than
these?" he will conclude that the question springs
rather from their querulousness than from their wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and make the best of the time, and of the conditions
of the time, in which it has pleased God to place him
(ver. 10).</p>

<p>But if any ask, "Why has he renounced the pursuit
of that wealth on which many are bent who are less
capable of using it than he?" the answer comes that
he has discovered Wisdom to be as good as Wealth, and
even better. Not only is Wisdom as secure a defence
against the ills of life as Wealth, but it has this great
advantage&mdash;that "it fortifies or vivifies the heart,"
while wealth often burdens and enfeebles it. Wisdom
quickens and braces the spirit for any fortune, gives it
new life or new strength, inspires an inward serenity
which does not lie at the mercy of outward accidents
(vv. 11, 12). It teaches a man to regard all the conditions
of life as ordained and shaped by God, and
weans him from the vain endeavour, on which many
exhaust their strength, to straighten that which God
has made crooked, that which crosses and thwarts his
inclinations (ver. 13); once let him see that the thing
is crooked, and was meant to be crooked, and he will
accept and adapt himself to it, instead of wearying
himself in futile attempts to make, or to think, it
straight.</p>

<p>And there is one very good reason why God should
permit many crooks in our lot, very good reason therefore
why a wise man should look on them with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
equal mind. For God sends the crooked as well as
the straight, adversity as well as prosperity, in order
that we should know that He has "made <i>this</i> as well
as <i>that</i>," and accept both from his benign hand. He
interlaces his providences, and veils his providences, in
order that, unable to foresee the future, we may learn
to put our trust in Him rather than in any earthly good
(ver. 14). It therefore behoves a man whose heart has
been bettered by much meditation, and by the reproofs
of the wise, to take both crooked and straight, both evil
and good, from the hand of God, and to trust in Him
whatever may befall.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Perils to
which it exposes
him.</i>
Ch. vii., v. 15-Ch.
viii., v. 13.</div>

<p>So far, I think, we shall follow and assent to this
theory of human life; our sympathies will go with the
man who seeks to acquire a good name,
to grow wise, to stand in the Golden
Mean. But when he proceeds to apply
his theory, to deduce practical rules from
it, we can only give him a qualified assent, nay,
must often altogether withhold our assent. The main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
conclusion he draws is, indeed, quite unobjectionable:
it is, that in action, as well as in opinion, we should
avoid excess, that we should keep the happy mean
between intemperance and indifference.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>He is likely to
compromise
Conscience</i>:
Ch. vii., vv.
15-20.</div>

<p>But the very first moral he infers from this conclusion
is open to the most serious objection. He
has seen both the righteous die in his
righteousness without receiving any reward
from it, and the wicked live long
in his wickedness to enjoy his ill-gotten
gains. And from these two mysterious facts, which
much exercised many of the Prophets and Psalmists of
Israel, he infers that a prudent man will neither be very
righteous, since he will gain nothing by it, and may
lose the friendship of those who are content with the
current morality; nor very wicked, since, though he
may lose little by this so long as he lives, he will very
surely hasten his death (vv. 16, 17). It is the part
of prudence to lay hold on both; to permit a temperate
indulgence both in virtue and in vice, carrying
neither to excess (ver. 18)&mdash;a doctrine still very dear
to the mere man of the world. In this temperance
there lies a strength greater than that of an army in
a beleaguered city; for no righteous man is wholly
righteous (vv. 19, 20): to aim at so lofty and ideal
will be to attempt "to wind ourselves too high for
mortal man below the sky;" we shall only fail if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
make the attempt; we shall be grievously disappointed
if we expect other men to succeed where we have
failed; we shall lose faith in them, and in ourselves;
we shall suffer many pangs of shame, remorse, and
defeated hope: and, therefore, it is well at once to make
up our minds that we are, and need be, no better than
our neighbours, that we are not to blame ourselves
for customary and occasional slips; that, if we are but
moderate, we may lay one hand on righteousness and
another on wickedness without taking much harm. A
most immoral moral, though it is as popular to-day as
it ever was.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To be indifferent
to Censure</i>:
Ch. vii., vv.
21, 22.</div>

<p>The second rule which this temperate Monitor infers
from his general theory is, That we are not to be overmuch
troubled by what people say about
us. Servants are adduced as an illustration,
partly, no doubt, because they are
commonly acquainted with their masters'
faults, and partly because they do sometimes speak
about them, and even exaggerate them. "Let them
speak," is his counsel, "and don't be too curious to
know what they say; you may be sure that they will
say pretty much what you often say of your neighbours
or superiors; if they depreciate you, you depreciate
others, and you can hardly expect a more generous
treatment than you accord." Now if this moral stood
alone, it would be both shrewd and wholesome. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
it does not stand alone; and in its connection it means,
I fear, that if we take the moderate course prescribed
by worldly prudence; if we are righteous without being
too righteous, and wicked without being too wicked,
and our neighbours should begin to say, "He is hardly
so good as he seems," or "I could tell a tale of him an
if I would," we are not to be greatly moved by "any
such ambiguous givings out;" we are not to be overmuch
concerned that our neighbours have discovered
our secret slips, since we have often discovered the like
slips in them, and know very well that "there is not
on earth a righteous man who doeth good and sinneth
not." In short, as we are not to be too hard on ourselves
for an occasional and decorous indulgence in vice,
so neither are we to be very much vexed by the censures
which neighbours as guilty as ourselves pass on
our conduct. Taken in this its connected sense, the
moral is as immoral as that which preceded it.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, our prudent Monitor drops a hint that
he himself is not content with a theory which leads to
such results. He has tried this "wisdom," but he is
not satisfied with it. He desired a higher wisdom,
suspecting that there must be a nobler theory of life
than this; but it was too far away for him to reach,
too deep for him to fathom. After all his researches
that which was far off remained far off, deep remained
deep: he could not attain the higher wisdom he sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
(vv. 23, 24). And so he falls back on the wisdom he
had tried, and draws a third moral from it which is
somewhat difficult to handle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To despise
Women</i>:
Ch. vii., vv.
25-29.</div>

<p>It is said of an English satirist that when any friend
confessed himself in trouble and asked his advice, his
first question was, "Who is she?"&mdash;taking
it for granted that a woman must
be at the bottom of the mischief. And
the Hebrew cynic appears to have been of his mind.
He cannot but see that the best of men sin sometimes,
that even the most temperate are hurried into excesses
which their prudence condemns. And when he turns
to discover what it is that bewitches them, he finds no
other solution of the mystery than&mdash;Woman. Sweet
and pleasant as she seems, she is "more bitter than
death," her heart is a snare, her hands are chains. He
whom God loves will escape from her net after brief
captivity; only the fool and the sinner are held fast in
it (vv. 25, 26). Nor is this a hasty conclusion. Our
Hebrew cynic has deliberately gone out, with the
lantern of his wisdom in his hand, to search for an
honest man and an honest woman. He has been
scrupulously careful in his search, "taking things," i.e.
indications of character, "one by one;" but though he
has found one honest man in a thousand, he has never
lit on an honest and good woman (vv. 27, 28). Was
not the fault in the eyes of the seeker rather than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
faces into which he peered? Perhaps it was. It would
be to-day and here; but was it there and on that far-distant
yesterday? The Orientals would still say "No."
All through the East, from the hour in which Adam
cast the blame of his disobedience on Eve to the present
hour, men have followed the example of their first
father. Even St. Chrysostom, who should have known
better, affirms that when the devil took from Job all he
had, he did not take his wife, "because he thought she
would greatly help him to conquer that saint of God."
Mohammed sings in the same key with the Christian
Father: he affirms that since the creation of the world
there have been only four perfect women, though it a
little redeems the cynicism of his speech to learn that,
of these four perfect women, one was his wife and
another his daughter; for the good man may have
meant a compliment to them rather than an insult to
the sex. But if there be any truth in this estimate,
if in the East the women were, and are, worse than the
men, it is the men who have made them what they are.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Robbed of their natural dignity and use as helpmeets,
condemned to be mere toys, trained only to minister
to sense, what wonder if they have fallen below their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
due place and honour? Of all cowardly cynicisms
that surely is the meanest which, denying women any
chance of being good, condemns them for being bad.
Our Hebrew cynic seems to have had some faint sense
of his unfairness; for he concludes his tirade against
the sex with the admission that "God made man upright"&mdash;the
word "man" here, as in Genesis, standing
for the whole race, male and female&mdash;and that if all
women, and nine hundred and ninety-nine men out
of every thousand, have become bad, it is because they
have degraded themselves and one another by the evil
"devices" they have sought out (ver. 29).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And to be indifferent
to
Public
Wrongs.</i>
Ch. viii., vv.
1-13.</div>

<p>The fourth and last rule inferred from this prudent
moderate view of life is, That we are to submit with
hopeful resignation to the wrongs which
spring from human tyranny and injustice.
Unclouded by gusts of passion, the wise
temperate Oriental carries a "bright
countenance" to the king's divan. Though the king
should rate him with "evil words," he will remember
his "oath of fealty," and not rise up in resentment,
still less rush out in open revolt. He knows that
the word of a king is potent; that it will be of no use
to show a hot mutinous temper; that by a meek endurance
of wrath he may allay or avert it. He knows,
too, that obedience and submission are not likely to
provoke insult and contumely; and that if now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
then he is exposed to an undeserved insult, any
defence, and especially an angry defence, will but
damage his cause (chap. viii., vv. 1-5). Moreover, a
man who keeps himself cool and will not permit anger
to blind him may, in the worst event, foresee that a
time of retribution will surely come on the king, or the
satrap, who is habitually unjust; that the people will
revolt from him and exact heavy penalties for the
wrongs they have endured; that death, "that fell
arrest without all bail," will carry him away. <i>He</i> can
see that time of retribution drawing nigh, although the
tyrant, fooled by impunity, is not aware of its approach;
he can also see that when it comes it will be as a war
in which no furlough is granted, and whose disastrous
close no craft can evade. All this execution of long-delayed
justice he has seen again and again; and
therefore he will not suffer his resentment to hurry
him into dangerous courses, but will calmly await the
action of those social laws which compel every man to
reap the due reward of his deeds (vv. 5-9).</p>

<p>Nevertheless he has also seen times in which retribution
did not overtake oppressors; times even when,
in the person of children as wicked and tyrannical as
themselves, they "came again" to renew their injustice,
and to blot out the memory of the righteous from
the earth (ver. 10). And such times have no more
disastrous result than this, that they undermine faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and subvert morality. Men see that no immediate
sentence is pronounced against the wicked, that they
live long in their wickedness and beget children to
perpetuate it; and the faith of the good in the overruling
providence of God is shaken and strained, while
the vast majority of men set themselves to do the evil
which flaunts its triumphs before their eyes (ver. 11).
None the less the Preacher is quite sure that it is the
part of wisdom to trust in the laws and look for the
judgments of God: he is quite sure that the triumph
of the wicked will soon pass, while that of the good
will endure (vv. 12, 13); and therefore, as a man
of prudent and forecasting spirit, he will submit to
injustice, but not inflict it, or at least not carry it to
any dangerous excess.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Preacher
condemns this
Theory of
Human Life,
and declares
the Quest to
be still unattained.</i>
Ch. viii., vv.
14, 15.</div>

<p>This is by no means a noble or lofty view of human
life; the line of conduct it prescribes is often as
immoral as it is ignoble; and we may
feel some natural surprise at hearing
counsels so base from the lips of the
inspired Hebrew Preacher. But we ought
to know him, and his method of instruction,
well enough by this time to be sure
that he is at least as sensible of their
baseness as we can be; that he is here speaking to us,
not in his own person, but dramatically, and from the
lips of the man who, that he may secure a good name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and an easy position in the world, is disposed to
accommodate himself to the current maxims of his time
and company. If we ever had any doubt on this
point, it is set at rest by the closing verses of the
Section before us. For in these verses the Preacher
lowers his mask, and tells us plainly that we cannot
and must not attempt to rest in the theory he has just
put before us, that to follow out its practical corollaries
will lead us away from the Chief Good, not toward it.
More than once he has already hinted to us that this
"wisdom" is not the highest wisdom; and now he
frankly avows that he is as unsatisfied as ever, as far
as ever from ending his Quest; that his last key will not
unlock those mysteries of life which have baffled him
from the first. He still holds, indeed, that it is better
to be righteous than to be wicked, though he now sees
that even the prudently righteous often have a wage like
that of the wicked, and that the prudently wicked often
have a wage like that of the righteous (ver. 14). This
new theory of life, therefore, he confesses to be "a
vanity" as great and deceptive as any of those he has
hitherto tried. And as even yet it does not suit him
to give us his true theory and announce his final
conclusion, he falls back on the conclusion we have so
often heard, that the best thing a man can do is to eat
and to drink, and to carry a clear enjoying temper
through all the days, and all the tasks, which God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
giveth him under the sun (ver. 15). How this familiar
conclusion fits into his final conclusion, and is part of
it, though not the whole, we shall see in our study of
the next and last section of the Book.</p>


<p>II.&mdash;If, as Milton sings,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i6">"To know</span>
<span class="i0">That which before us lies in daily life</span>
<span class="i0">Is the prime wisdom,"</span>
</div>

<p>we are surely much indebted to the Hebrew Preacher.
<i>He</i> does not "sit on a hill apart" discussing fate,
freewill, foreknowledge absolute, or any lofty abstruse
theme. He walks with us, in the common round, to
the daily task, and talks to us of that which lies before
and around us in our daily life. Nor does he speak
as one raised high above the folly and weakness by
which we are constantly betrayed. He has trodden
the very paths we tread. He shares our craving and
has pursued our quest after "that which is good."
He has been misled by the illusions by which we are
beguiled. And his aim is to save us from fruitless
researches and defeated hopes by placing his experience
at our command. He speaks, therefore, to our real
need, and speaks with a cordial sympathy which renders
his counsel very welcome.</p>

<p>We are so made that we can find no rest until we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
find a supreme Good, a Good which will satisfy all our
faculties, passions, aspirations. For <i>this</i> we search
with ardour; but our ardour is not always under law
to wisdom. We often assume that we have reached
our chief Good while it is still far off, or that we are at
least looking for it in the right direction when in truth
we have turned our back upon it. Sometimes we seek
for it in the pursuit of knowledge, sometimes in pleasure
and self-indulgence, sometimes in fervent devotion to
secular affairs; sometimes in love, sometimes in wealth,
and sometimes in a modest yet competent provision
for our future wants. And if, when we have acquired
the special good we seek, we find that our hearts are
still craving and restless, still hungering for a larger
good, we are apt to think that if we had a little more
of that which so far has disappointed us; if we were
somewhat wiser, or if our pleasures were more varied;
if we had a little more love or a larger estate, all would
be well with us, and we should be at peace. Perhaps
in time we get our "little more," but still our hearts
do not cry, "Hold, enough!"&mdash;enough being always
a little more than we have; till at last, weary and
disappointed in our quest, we begin to despair of
ourselves and to distrust the goodness of God. "If
God be good," we ask, "why has He made us thus&mdash;always
seeking yet never finding, urged on by imperious
appetites which are never satisfied, impelled by hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
which for ever elude our grasp?" And because we
cannot answer the question, we cry out, "Vanity of
vanities! all is vanity and vexation of spirit!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no," replies the kindly Preacher who has
himself known this despairing mood and surmounted
it; "no, <i>all</i> is not vanity. There is a chief Good, a
satisfying Good, although you have not found it yet;
and you have not found it because you have not looked
for it where alone it can be found. Once take the
right path, follow the right clue, and you will find a
Good which will make all else good to you, a Good
which will lend a new sweetness to your wisdom and
your mirth, your labour and your gain." But men are
very slow to believe that they have wasted their time
and strength, that they have wholly mistaken their
path; they are reluctant to believe that a little more
of that of which they have already acquired so much,
and which they have always held to be best, will not
yield them the satisfaction they seek. And therefore
the wise Preacher, instead of telling us at once where
the true Good is to be found, takes much pains to
convince us that it is not to be found where we have
been wont to seek it. He places before us a man of
the largest wisdom, whose pleasures were exquisitely
varied and combined, a man whose devotion to affairs
was the most perfect and successful, a man of imperial
nature and wealth, and whose heart had glowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
all the fervours of love: and this man&mdash;<i>himself</i> under
a thin disguise&mdash;so rarely gifted and of such ample
conditions, confesses that he could not find the Chief
Good in any one of the directions in which we
commonly seek it, although he had travelled farther in
every direction than we can hope to go. If we are of
a rational temper, if we are open to argument and
persuasion, if we are not resolved to buy our own
experience at a heavy, perhaps a ruinous, cost, how
can we but accept the wise Hebrew's counsel, and
cease to look for the satisfying Good in quarters in
which he assures us it is not to be found?</p>

<p>We have already considered his argument as it bore
on the men of his own time; we have now to make its
application to our own age. As his custom is, the
Preacher does not develop his argument in open logical
sequence; he does not write a moral essay, but paints
us a dramatic picture.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
Wealth.</i>
Ch. vi.</div>

<p>He depicts a man who trusts in riches, who honestly
believes that wealth is the chief Good, or, at lowest,
the way to it. This man has laboured diligently
and dexterously to acquire affluence,
and he <i>has</i> acquired it. Like the
rich man of the Parable, he has much goods, and barns
that grow fuller as they grow bigger. "God has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
him riches and wealth and abundance, so that his soul"&mdash;not
having learned how to look for anything higher&mdash;"lacks
nothing of all that it desireth."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Man who
makes Riches
his Chief Good
is haunted by
Fears and Perplexities.</i>
Ch. vi., vv.
1-6.</div>

<p>He has reached his aim, then, acquired what he
holds to be good. Can he not be content with it?
No; for though he bids his soul make
merry and be glad, it obstinately refuses
to obey. It is darkened with perplexities,
haunted by vague longings, fretted
and stung with perpetual care. Now that
he has his riches, he goes in dread lest
he should lose them; he is unable to decide how he
may best employ them, or how to dispose of them when
he must leave them behind him. God has given them
to him; but he is not at all sure that God will show an
equal wisdom in giving them to some one else when he
is gone. And so the poor rich man sits steeped in
wealth up to his chin&mdash;up to his chin, but not up to his
lips, for he has no "power to enjoy" it. Burdened
with jealous care, he grudges that others should share
what he cannot enjoy, grudges above all that, when
he is dead, another should possess what has been of
so little comfort to him. "If thou art rich," says
Shakespeare,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i6">"thou art poor;</span>

</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>But our rich man is not only like an ass; he is even
more stupid: for the ass would not have his back
bent even with golden ingots if he could help it, and is
only too thankful when the burden is lifted from his
back; while the rich man not only <i>will</i> plod on beneath
his heavy load, but, in his dread of being unladen at
his journey's end, imposes on himself a burden heavier
than all his ingots, <i>and will bear that</i> as well as his gold.
He creeps along beneath his double load, and brays
quite pitifully if you so much as put out a hand to
ease him.</p>

<p>It is not of much use, perhaps, to argue with one so
besotted; but lest we should slip into his degraded
estate, the Preacher points out for our instruction
the source of his disquiet, and
shows why it is impossible in the very
nature of things that he should know content.
Among other sources of disquiet he notes these
three. (1) That "there are many things which increase
vanity:" that is to say, many of the acquisitions of the
rich man only augment his outward pomp and state.
Beyond a certain point he cannot possibly enjoy the
good things he possesses; he cannot, for instance, live
in all his costly mansions at once, nor eat and drink all
the sumptuous fare set on his table, nor carry his
whole wardrobe on his back. He is hampered with
superfluities which breed care, but yield him no comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
And, as he grudges that others should enjoy
them, all this abundance, all that goes beyond his
personal gratification, so far from being an "advantage"
to him, is only a burden and a
torment. (2) Another source of disquiet
is, that no man, not even he, "can
tell what is good for man in life," what
will be really helpful and pleasant to him. Many
things which attract desire pall upon the taste. And
as "the day of our vain life is brief," gone "like a
shadow," he may flit away before he has had a chance
of using much that he has laboriously
acquired. (3) And a third source of disquiet
is, that the more a man has the
more he must leave: and this is a fact
which cuts him two ways, with a keen double edge.
For the more he has the less he likes leaving it; and
the more he has the more is he puzzled how to leave
it. He cannot tell "what shall be after him," and so
he makes one will to-day and another to-morrow, and
very likely dies intestate after all.</p>

<p>Is not that a true picture, a picture true to life?
Bulwer Lytton tells us how one of our wealthiest peers
once complained to him that he was never so happy
and well-served as when he was a bachelor in chambers;
that his splendid mansion was a dreary solitude to
him, and the long train of domestics his masters rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
than his servants. And more than once he depicts, as
in <i>The Caxtons</i>, a man of immense fortune and estate as
so occupied in learning and discharging the heavy duties
of property, so tied and hampered by the thought of
what was expected of him, as to fret under a constant
weight of care and to lose all the sweet uses of life.
And have not we ourselves known men who have
grown more penurious as they have grown richer, men
unable to decide what it would be really good or even
pleasant for them to do, more and more anxious as to
how they should devise their abundance? "I am a
poor rich man, burdened with money; but I have
nothing else," was the saying of a notorious millionaire,
who died while he was signing a cheque for £10,000,
some twenty years ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And because
God has put
Eternity into
his Heart, He
cannot be content
with Temporal
Good.</i>
Ch. vi., vv. 7-10.</div>

<p>But the Hebrew Preacher is not content to paint a
picture of the Rich Man and his perplexities&mdash;a picture
as true to the life now as it was then.
He also points out <i>how</i> it is that the lover
of riches came to be the man he is, and
why he can never lay hold on the supreme
Good. "All the labour of this man is for
his mouth," for the senses and whatever
gratifies sense; and therefore, however prosperous he
may be, "yet his soul cannot be satisfied." For the
soul is not fed by that which feeds the senses. God
has "put eternity" into it. It craves an eternal sustenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
It cannot rest till it gains access to "the
living water," and "the meat which endureth," and
the good "wine of the kingdom." A beast&mdash;if indeed
beasts have no souls, which I neither deny nor admit&mdash;may
be content if only he be placed in comfortable
outward conditions; but a man, simply because he is
a man, must have a wholesome and happy inward life
before he can be content. His hunger and thirst after
righteousness must be satisfied. He must know that,
when flesh and heart fail him, he will be received into
an eternal habitation. He must have a treasure which
the moth cannot corrupt, nor the thief filch from him.
We cannot escape our nature any more than we can
jump off our shadow; and our very nature cries out
for an immortal good. Hence it is that the rich man
who trusts in his riches, and not in the God who gave
them to him, carries within him a hungry craving soul.
Hence it is that <i>all</i> who trust in riches, and hold them
to be the Chief Good, are restless and unsatisfied. For,
as the Preacher reminds us, it is very true both that
the rich man may not be a fool, and that the poor man
may trust in the riches he has not won. By virtue of
his wisdom, the wise rich man may so vary and combine
the good things of this life as to win from them
a gratification denied to the sot whose sordid heart is
set on gold; and the poor man, because he has so
few of the enjoyments which wealth can buy, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
snatch at the few that come his way with the violent
delight which has violent ends. Both may "enjoy the
good they have" rather than "crave a good beyond
their (present) reach:" but if they mistake that good
for the Supreme Good, neither their poverty nor their
wisdom will save them from the misery of a fatal
mistake. For they too have souls, <i>are</i> souls; and the
soul is not to be satisfied with that which goes in at
the mouth. Wise or foolish, rich or poor, whosoever
<i>trusts</i> in riches is either like the ass whose back is
bent with a weight of gold, or he is worse than the
ass, and <i>longs</i> to take a burden on his back of which
only Death can unlade him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Quest in
the Golden
Mean.</i>
Ch. vii., v. 1-Ch.
viii., v. 15.</div>

<p>2. But now, to come closer home, to draw nearer
to that prime wisdom which consists in knowing that
which lies before us in our daily life, let
us glance at the Man who aims to stand
in the Golden Mean; the man who does
not aspire to heap up a great fortune,
but is anxious to secure a modest competence. He is
more on our own level; for <i>our</i> trust in riches is, for
the most part, qualified by other trusts. If we believe
in Gold, we also believe in Wisdom and in Mirth;
if we labour to provide for the future, we also wish
to use and enjoy the present. We think it well that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
we should know something of the world about us, and
take some pleasure in our life. We think that to put
money in our purse should not be our only aim, though
it should be a leading aim. We admit that "the love
of money is a root of all evil"&mdash;one of the roots from
which all forms and kinds of evil may spring; and,
to save ourselves from falling into that base lust, we
limit our desires. We shall be content if we can put
by a moderate sum, and we flatter ourselves that we
desire even so much as that, not for its own sake, but
for the means of knowledge, or of usefulness, or of
innocent enjoyment with which it will furnish us.
"Nothing I should like better," says many a man,
"than to retire from business as soon as I have enough
to live upon, and to devote myself to this branch of
study or that province of art, or to take my share of
public duties, or to give myself to a cheerful domestic
life." It speaks well for our time, I think, that while
in a few large cities there are still many in haste to
be rich and very rich, in the country and in hundreds
of provincial towns there are thousands of men who
know that wealth is not the Chief Good, and who do
not care to don the livery of Mammon. Nevertheless,
though their aim be "most sweet and commendable,"
it has perils of its own, imminent and deadly perils,
which few of us altogether escape. And these perils
are clearly set before us in the sketch of the Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Preacher. As I reproduce that sketch, suffer me, for
the sake of brevity, while carefully retaining the antique
outlines, to fill in with modern details.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Method of
the Man who
seeks a Competence.</i>
Ch. viii., vv.
1-14.</div>

<p>Suppose a young man to start in life with this
theory, this plan, this aim, distinctly before him:&mdash;he is
to be ruled by prudence and plain common
sense: he will try to stand well with the
world, and to make a moderate provision
for future wants. This aim will beget a
certain temperance of thought and action.
He will permit himself no extravagances&mdash;no wandering
out of bounds, and perhaps no enthusiasms, for he wants
to establish "a good name," a good reputation, which
shall go before him like "a sweet perfume" and dispose
men's hearts toward him. And, therefore, he carries
a sober face, frequents the company of older, wiser men,
is grateful for any hints their experience may furnish,
and takes even their "reproof" with a good grace. He
walks in the beaten paths, knowing the world to be impatient
of novelties. The wanton mirth and crackling
laughter of fools in the house of feasting are not for
him. He is not to be seduced from the plain prudent
course which he has marked out for himself whether
by inward provocation or outward allurements. If he
is a young lawyer, he will write no poetry, attorneys
holding literary men in suspicion. If he is a young
doctor, hom&oelig;opathy, hydropathy, and all new-fangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
schemes of medicine will disclose their charms to him
in vain. If he is a young clergyman, he will be conspicuous
for his orthodoxy, and for his emphatic assent
to all that the leaders of opinion in the Church think or
may think. If he is a young manufacturer or merchant,
he will be no breeder of costly patents and inventions,
but will be among the first to profit by them whenever
they are found to pay. Whatever he may be, he will
not be of those who try to make crooked things straight
and rough places plain. He wants to get on; and the
best way to get on is to keep the beaten path and push
forward in that. And he will be patient&mdash;not throwing
up the game because for a time the chances go against
him, but waiting till the times mend and his chances
improve, so far as he can, he will keep the middle of
the stream that, when the tide which leads on to fortune
sets in, he may be of the best to take it at the flood
and sail easily on to his desired haven.</p>

<p>In all this there may be no conscious insincerity, and
not much perhaps that calls for censure. For all young
men are not wise with the highest wisdom, nor original,
nor brave with the courage which follows Truth in
scorn of consequence. And our young man may not
be dowered with the love of loves, the hate of hates,
the scorn of scorns. He may be of a nature essentially
prudent and commonplace, or training and habit
may have superinduced a second nature. To him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
primrose may be a primrose and nothing more; his
instinctive thought, as he looks at it, may be how he can
reproduce its colour in some of his textures or extract
a saleable perfume from its nectared cup. He may
even think that primroses are a mistake, and that 'tis
pity they were not pot-herbs; or he may assume that
he shall have plenty of time to gather primroses by-and-bye,
but that for the present he must be content to
pick pot-herbs for the market. In his way, he may even
be a religious man; he may admit that both prosperity
and adversity are of God, that we must take patiently
whatever He may send; and he may heartily desire to
be on good terms with Him who alone "can order all
things as He please."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Perils to
which it exposes
him.</i>
Ch. vii., v. 15-Ch.
viii., v. 13.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>He is likely to
compromise
Conscience</i>;
Ch. vii., vv.
15-20.</div>

<p>But here we light on his first grave peril; for he will
carry his temperance into his religion, and he may
subordinate even that to his desire to get
on. Looking on men in their religious
aspect, he sees that they are divided into
two classes, the righteous and the wicked.
As he considers them, he concludes that on the whole
the righteous have the best of it, that godliness is real
gain. But he soon discovers that this
first rough conclusion needs to be carefully
qualified. For, as he studies men
more closely, he perceives that at times
the righteous die in their righteousness without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the better for it, and the wicked live on in their
wickedness without being the worse for it. He perceives
that while the very wicked die before their time,
the very righteous, those who are always reaching
forth to that which is before them and rising to new
heights of insight and obedience, are "forsaken," that
they are left alone in the thinly-peopled solitude to
which they have climbed, losing the sympathy even of
those who once walked with them. Now, these are
facts; and a prudent sensible man tries to accept facts,
and to adjust himself to them, even when they are adverse
to his wishes and conclusions. <i>He</i> does not want to
be left alone, nor to die before his time. And therefore,
taking these new facts into account, he infers that it
will be best to be good without being too good, and
to indulge himself with an occasional lapse into some
general and customary wickedness without being too
wicked. Nay, he is disposed to believe that "whoso
feareth God," studying the facts of his providence and
drawing logical inferences from them, "will lay hold
of both" wickedness and righteousness, and will blend
them in that proportion which the facts seem to favour.
But here Conscience protests, urging that to do evil can
never be good. To pacify it, he adduces the notorious
fact that "there is not a righteous man on earth who
doeth good, and sinneth not." "Conscience," he says,
"you are really too strict and straitlaced, too hard on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
one who wants to do as well as he can. You go quite
too far. How can you expect me to be better than
great saints and men after God's own heart?" And
so, with a wronged and pious air, he turns to lay one
hand on wickedness and another on righteousness,
quite content to be no better than his neighbours
and to let Conscience sulk herself into a sweeter
mood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To be indifferent
to Censure</i>;
Ch. vii., vv. 21,
22.</div>

<p>Conscience being silenced, Prudence steps in. And
Prudence says, "People will talk. They will take note
of your slips, and tattle about them. Unless
you are very very careful, you will
damage your reputation; and if you do
that, how can you hope to get on?"
Now as the man is specially devoted to Prudence, and
has found her kind mistress and useful monitress in
one, he is at first a little staggered to find her taking
part against him. But he soon recovers himself, and
replies: "Dear Prudence, you know as well as I do
that people don't like a man to be better than themselves.
Of course they will talk if they catch me
tripping; but I don't mean to do more than trip, and
a man who trips gains ground in recovering himself,
and goes all the faster for a while. Besides we all
trip; some fall even. And I talk of my neighbours
just as they talk of me; and we all like each other the
better for being birds of one feather."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To despise
Women</i>;
Ch. vii., vv.
25-29.</div>

<p>At this Prudence smiles and stops her mouth. But
being very willing to assist so quick-witted a disciple,
she presently returns and says: "Are
you not rather a long while in securing
your little Competence? Is there no
short cut to it? Why not take a wife
with a small fortune of her own, or with connexions
who could help you on?" Now the man, not being
a bad man, but one who would fain be good so far as
he knows goodness, is somewhat taken aback by such
a suggestion as this. He thinks Prudence must be
growing very worldly and mercenary. He says within
himself, "Surely <i>love</i> should be sacred! A man should
not prostitute <i>that</i> in order to get on! If I marry a
woman simply or mainly for her money, what worse
degradation can I inflict on her or on myself? how
shall I be better than those old Hebrews and Orientals
who held women to be only a toy or a convenience? To
do that, would be to make a snare and a net of her
indeed, to degrade her from her true place and function,
and possibly would lead me to think of her as even
worse than I had made her." Nevertheless, his heart
being very much set on securing a Competence, and an
accident of the sort which he calls "providences"
putting a foolish woman with a pocketful of money in
his way, he takes both the counsel of Prudence and a
wife to match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And to be indifferent
to
Public
Wrongs.</i>
Ch. viii., vv.
1-13.</div>

<p>The world, we may be sure, thinks none the worse
of him for that. Once more he has proved himself a
man whose eye is stedfastly bent on "the
main chance," and who knows how to
seize occasions as they rise. But he, who
has thus profaned the inner sanctuary of
his own soul, is not likely to be sensitive
to the large claims of public duty. If he sees oppression,
if the tyranny of a man or a class mounts to a
height which calls for rebuke and opposition, <i>he</i> is not
likely to sacrifice comfort and risk either property or
popularity that he may assail iniquity in her strong
places. It is not such men as he who, when the times
are out of joint, feel that they are born to set them
right. Prudence is still his guide, and Prudence says,
"Let things alone; they will right themselves in time.
The social laws will avenge themselves on the head of
the oppressor, and deliver the oppressed. You can do
little to hasten their action. Why, to gain so little,
should you risk so much?" And the man is content
to sit still with folded hands when every hand that can
strike a blow for right is wanted in the strife, and can
even quote texts of Scripture to prove that in "quietness,
and confidence" in the action of Divine Laws, is
the true strength.</p>

<p>Now I make my appeal to those who daily enter the
world of business&mdash;is not this the tone of that world?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
are not these the very perils to which you lie open?
How often have you heard men recount
the slips of the righteous in order to
justify themselves for not assuming to
be righteous overmuch! How often have
you heard them vindicate their own
occasional errors by citing the errors of
those who give greater heed to religion
than they do, or make a louder profession of it!
How often have you heard them congratulate a
neighbour on his good luck in carrying off an heiress,
or speak of wedded love itself as a mere help to
worldly advancement! How often have you heard
them sneer at the nonsensical enthusiasm which
has led certain men to "throw away their chances in
life" in order to devote themselves to the service of
truth, or to forfeit popularity that they might lead a
forlorn hope against customary wrongs, and thank God
that no such maggot ever bit their brains! If during the
years which have lapsed since I too "went on 'Change,"
the general tone has not risen a whole heaven&mdash;and I
have heard of no such miracle&mdash;I know that you must
daily hear such things as these, and worse than these;
and that not only from irreligious men of bad character,
but from men who take a fair place in our Christian
congregations. From the time of the wise Preacher
to the present hour, this sort of talk has been going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
on, and the scheme of life from which it springs has
been stoutly held. There is the more need, therefore,
for you to listen to and weigh the Preacher's conclusion.
For his conclusion is, that this scheme of
life is wholly and irredeemably wrong, that it tends
to make a man a coward and a slave, that it cannot
satisfy the large desires of the soul, and that it cheats
him of the Chief Good. His conclusion is, that the man
who so sets his heart on acquiring even a Competence
that he cannot be content without it, has no genuine
trust in God, since he is willing to give in to immoral
maxims and customs in order to secure that which,
as he thinks, will make him largely independent of
the Divine Providence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII., Ver. 16, to Chap. XII., Ver. 7.</span></p>


<p>At last we approach the end of our Quest. The
Preacher has found the Chief Good, and will
show us where to find it. But are we even yet prepared
to welcome it and to lay hold of it? Apparently
he thinks we are not. For, though he has
already warned us that it is not to be found in
Wealth or Industry, in Pleasure or Wisdom, he repeats
his warning in this last Section of his Book,
as if he still suspected us of hankering after our
old errors. Not till he has again assured us that we
shall miss our mark if we seek the supreme Good in
any of the directions in which it is commonly sought,
does he direct us to the sole path in which we shall
not seek in vain. Once more, therefore, we must gird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
up the loins of our mind to follow him along his
several lines of thought, encouraged by the assurance
that the end of our journey is not now far off.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Chief Good
not to be found
in Wisdom</i>:
Ch. viii., v. 16-Ch.
ix., v. 6.</div>

<p>1. The Preacher commences this Section by carefully
defining his position and equipment as he starts
on his final course. As yet he carries no
lamp of Revelation in his hand, although
he will not venture beyond a certain
point without it. For the present he will
trust to Reason and Experience, and mark the conclusions
to which these conduct when unaided by any
direct light from Heaven. His first conclusion is that
Wisdom, which of all temporal goods still stands foremost
with him, is incapable of yielding a true content.
Much as it can do for man, it cannot solve the moral
problems which task and afflict his heart, the problems
which he <i>must</i> solve before he can be at peace. He
may be so bent on solving these by Wisdom as to see
"no sleep with his eyes by day or night;" he may
rely on Wisdom with a confidence so genuine as to
suppose at times that by its help he has "found out all
the work of God"&mdash;really solved all the mysteries of
the Divine Providence; but nevertheless "he has not
found it out;" the illusion will soon pass, and the unsolved
mysteries reappear dark and sombre as of old
(chap. viii., vv. 16, 17). And the proof that he has
failed is, first, that he is as incompetent to foresee the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
future as those who are not so wise as he. With all
his sagacity, he cannot tell whether he shall meet "the
love or the hatred" of his fellows. His lot is as closely
hidden in "the hand of God" as theirs, although he
may be as much better as he is wiser than they
(chap. ix., ver. 1). A second proof is that "the same
fate" overtakes both the wise and the foolish, the
righteous and the wicked, and he is as unable to escape
it as any of his neighbours. All die; and to men
ignorant of the heavenly hope of the Gospel the indiscrimination
of Death seems the most cruel and hopeless
of wrongs. The Preacher, indeed, is not ignorant of
that bright hope; but as yet he has not taken the
lamp of Revelation into his hand: he is simply speaking
the thought of those who have no higher guide
than Reason, no brighter light than Reflection. And
to these, their wisdom having taught them that to do
right is infinitely better than to do wrong, no fact was
so monstrous and inscrutable as that their lives should
run to the same disastrous close with the lives of evil
and violent men, that all alike should fall into the hands
of "that churl, Death." As they revolved this fact,
their hearts grew hot with a fierce resentment as
natural as it was impotent, a resentment all the hotter
because they knew how impotent it was. Therefore
the Preacher dwells on this fact, lingers over his description
of it, adding touch to touch. "One fate comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to all," he says, "to the righteous and to the wicked,
to the pure and to the impure, to the religious and to the
irreligious, to the profane and to the reverent." If death
be a good, the maddest fool and the vilest reprobate
share it with the sage and the saint. If death be an
evil, it is inflicted on the good as well as on the bad.
None is exempt. Of all wrongs this is the greatest; of
all problems this is the most insoluble. Nor is there
any doubt as to the nature of death. To him for whom
there shines no light of hope behind the darkness of
the grave, death is the supreme evil. For to the living,
however deject and wretched, there is still some hope
that times may mend: even though in outward condition
despicable as that unclean outcast, a dog&mdash;the
homeless and masterless scavenger of Eastern cities&mdash;he
has some advantage over the royal lion who, once
couched on a throne, now lies in the dust rotting to
dust. The living know at least that they must die; but
the dead know not anything. The living can recall the
past, and their memory harps fondly on notes which
were once most sweet; but the very memory of the
dead has perished, no music of the happy past can
revive on their dulled sense, nor will any recall their
names. The heavens are fair; the earth is beautiful
and generous; the works of men are many and diverse
and great; but they have "no more any portion for
ever in ought that is done under the sun" (vv. 2-6).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>This is the Preacher's description of the hapless
estate of the dead. His words would go straight home
to the hearts of the men for whom he wrote, with a
force even beyond that which they would have for
heathen races. In their Captivity, they had renounced
the worship of idols. They had renewed their covenant
with Jehovah. Many of them were devoutly attached
to the ordinances and commandments which they and
their fathers had neglected in happier and more prosperous
years. Yet their lives were made bitter to them
with cruel bondage, and they had as little hope in their
death as the Persians who embittered their lives, and
probably even less. It was in this sore strait, and
under the strong compulsions of this dreadful extremity,
that the more studious and pious of their rabbis, like
the Preacher himself, drew into an expressive context
the passages scattered through their Sacred Books
which hinted at a retributive life beyond the tomb, and
settled into that firm persuasion of the immortality of
the soul which, as a rule, they never henceforth altogether
let go. But when the Preacher wrote, this
settled and general conviction had not been reached.
There were many among them who, as their thoughts
circled round the mystery of death, could only cry,
"Is this <i>the end</i>? is <i>this</i> the end?" To the great
majority of them it seemed the end. And even the
few, who sought an answer to the question by blending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the Greek and Oriental with the Hebrew Wisdom,
attained no clear answer to it. To mere human
wisdom, Life remained a mystery, and Death a
mystery still more cruel and impenetrable. Only
those who listened to the Preachers and Prophets
taught of God beheld the dawn which already began
to glimmer on the darkness in which men sat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nor in Pleasure</i>:
Ch. ix., vv. 7-12.</div>

<p>Imagine, then, a Jew brought to the bitter pass which
Coheleth has described. He has acquainted himself
with Wisdom, native and foreign; and
wisdom has led him to conclusions of
virtue. Nor is he of those who love
virtue as they love music&mdash;without practising it.
Believing that a righteous and religious carriage of
himself will ensure happiness and equip him to
encounter the problems of life, he has striven to be
good and pure, to offer his sacrifices and pay his vows.
But he has found that, despite his best endeavours, his
life is not tranquil, that the very calamities which overtake
the wicked overtake him, that that wise carriage
of himself by which he thought to win love has provoked
hatred, that death remains a frowning and
inhospitable mystery. He hates death, and has no
great love for the life which has brought him only
labour and disappointment. Where is he likely to
turn next? Wisdom having failed him, to what will
he apply? At what conclusion will he arrive? Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
not his conclusion be that standing conclusion of the
baffled and the hapless, "Let us eat and drink for
to-morrow we die"? Will he not say, "Why should
I weary myself any more with studies which yield no
certain science, and self-denials which meet with no
reward? If a wise and pure conduct cannot secure
me from the evils I dread, let me at least try to forget
them and to grasp such poor delights as are still within
my reach?" This, at all events, <i>is</i> the conclusion in
which the Preacher lands him; and hence he takes
occasion to review the pretensions of Pleasure or Mirth.
To the baffled and hopeless devotee of Wisdom he
says, "Go, then, eat thy bread with gladness, and
drink thy wine with a merry heart. Cease to trouble
yourself about God and His judgments. He, as you
have seen, does not mete out rewards and punishments
according to our merit or demerit; and as He does not
punish the wicked after their deserts, you may be sure
that He has long since accepted your wise virtuous endeavours,
and will keep no score against you. Deck
yourself in white festive garments; let no perfume
be lacking to your head; add to your harem any
woman who charms your eye: and, as the day of
your life is brief at the best, let no hour of it slip
by unenjoyed. As you have chosen Mirth for your
portion, be as merry as you may. Whatever you can
get, get; whatever you can do, do. You are on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
road to the dark dismal grave where there is no work
nor device; there is, therefore, the more reason why
your journey should be a merry one" (vv. 7-10).</p>

<p>Thus the Preacher describes the Man of Pleasure,
and the maxims by which he rules his life. How true
the description is I need not tarry to prove; 'tis a point
every man can judge for himself. Judge also whether
the warning which the Preacher subjoins be not equally
true to experience (vv. 11, 12). For, after having
depicted, or personated, the Man who trusts in Wisdom,
and the Man who devotes himself to Pleasure, he proceeds
to show that even the Man who blends mirth
with study, whose wisdom preserves him from the
disgusts of satiety and vulgar lust, is nevertheless&mdash;to
say nothing of the Chief Good&mdash;very far from having
reached a certain good. <i>Then</i>, at least, "the race was
not (always) to the swift, nor the battle to the strong;
neither was bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent,
nor favour to the learned." Those who had the
fairest chances had not always the happiest success;
nor did those who bent themselves most strongly to
their ends always reach their ends. Those who were
wanton as birds, or heedless as fish, were often taken
in the snare of calamity or swept up by the net of
misfortune. At any moment a killing frost might
blight all the growths of Wisdom and destroy all
the sweet fruits of Pleasure: and if they had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
these, what could they do but starve when they
were gone? The good which was at the mercy of
accident, which might vanish before the instant touch
of disease or loss or pain, was not worthy to be,
or to be compared with, the Chief Good, which is
a good for all times, in all accidents and conditions,
and renders him who has it equal to all events.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nor in Devotion
to Affairs
and its Rewards.</i>
Ch. ix., v. 13-Ch.
x., v. 20.</div>

<p>So far, then, Coheleth has been occupied in retracing
the argument of the first Section of the Book. Now
he returns upon the second and third
Sections: he deals with the man who
plunges into public affairs, who turns his
wisdom to practical account, and seeks
to attain a competence, if not a fortune.
He lingers over this stage of his argument, probably
because the Jews, then as always, even in exile and
under the most cruel oppression, were a remarkably
energetic, practical, money-getting race, with a singular
faculty of dealing with political issues or handling the
market; and, as he slowly pursues it, he drops many
hints of the social and political conditions of the time.
Two features of it he takes much to heart: first, that
wisdom, even of the most practical and sagacious sort,
did not win its fair recognition and reward&mdash;a very
natural complaint in so wise a man; and, secondly,
that his people were under tyrants so gross, self-indulgent,
indolent, and unstatesman-like as the Persians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of his day&mdash;also a natural complaint in a man of so
wise and patriotic a spirit.</p>

<p>He opens with an anecdote in proof of the slight
regard in which the most valuable and remunerative
sagacity was held. He tells us of a poor man&mdash;and
I have sometimes thought that this poor man may have
been the Author himself; for the military leaders of
the Jews, though among the most expert strategists
of that era, were often very learned and studious men&mdash;who
lived in a little city, with only a few inhabitants.
A great king came up against the city, besieged it,
threw up the lofty military causeway, as high as the
walls, from which it was the fashion of the time to
deliver the assault. By his Archimedian wit the poor
man hit on a stratagem which saved the city; but
though his service was so signal, and the city so little
that the "few men in it" must have seen him every
day, "yet no one remembered that same poor man,"
or lent a hand to lift him from his poverty. Wise
as he was, his wisdom did not bring him bread, nor
riches, nor favour (vv. 13-15). Therefore, concludes the
Preacher, wisdom, great gift though it is, and better, as
in this instance, than "an army to a beleaguered city"
(chap, vii., ver. 19), is not of itself sufficient to secure
success. A poor man's wisdom&mdash;as many an inventor
has found&mdash;is despised even by those who profit by it.
Although his counsel, in the day of extremity, is infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
more valuable than the loud bluster of fools, or of a
ruler among fools, nevertheless the ruler, because he
is foolish, may be affronted to find one of the poorest
men in the place wiser than himself; he may easily
cast his "merit in the eye of scorn," and so rob him
both of the honour and the reward of his achievement
(vv. 16, 17)&mdash;an ancient saw not without modern
instances. For the fool is a greater power in the
world, especially the fool who is wise in his own
conceit. Insignificant in himself, he may nevertheless
do great harm and "destroy much good." Just as a
tiny fly, when it is dead, may make the sweetest
ointment offensive by infusing its own evil savour, so
a man, when his wit is gone, may with his little folly
cause many sensible men to distrust the wisdom they
should honour (chap. x., ver. 1):&mdash;who has not met
such a hot-headed want-wit in, for example, the lobbies
of the House of Commons? To a wise man, such as
Coheleth, the fool, the presumptuous conceited fool,
is "rank and smells to heaven," infesting sweeter
natures than his own with a most pestilent corruption.
He paints us a picture of him&mdash;paints it with a keen
graphic scorn which, if the eyes of the fool were in
his head (chap. ii., ver. 14), and "what he is pleased
to call his mind" could for a moment shift from his
left hand to his right (ver. 2), might make him nearly
as contemptible to himself as he is to others. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
we read ver. 3 the unhappy wretch stands before us.
We see him coming out of his house; he goes dawdling
down the street, for ever wandering from the path,
attracted by the merest trifle, staring at familiar objects
with eyes that have no recognition in them, knowing
neither himself nor others; and, with pointed finger,
chuckles after every sober citizen he meets, "There
goes a fool!"</p>

<p>Yet a fool quite as foolish and malignant as this,
quite as indecent even in outward behaviour, may be
lifted to high place, and has ere now sat on an imperial
throne.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The Preacher had seen many of them suddenly
raised to power, while nobles were depraved, and
high functionaries of State reduced to an abject servitude.
Now if the poor wise man have to attend the
durbar, or sit in the divan, of a foolish capricious
despot, how should he bear himself? The Preacher
counsels meekness and submission. He is to sit unruffled
even though the ruler should rate him, lest by
resentment he should provoke some graver outrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
(vv. 4-7: comp. chap. viii., ver. 3). To strengthen him
in his submission, the Preacher hints at cautions and
consolations which, because free and open speech was
very dangerous under the Persian despotism, he wraps
up in obscure maxims capable of a double sense&mdash;nay,
as the commentators have shown, capable of a good
many more senses than two&mdash;to the true sense of
which "a foolish ruler" was by no means likely to
penetrate, even if they fell into his hands.</p>

<p>The first of these maxims is, "He who diggeth a
pit shall fall into it" (ver. 8). And the allusion is, of
course, to an Eastern mode of trapping wild beasts and
game. The huntsman dug a pit, covered it with twigs
and sods, and strewed the surface with bait; but as
he dug many such pits, and some of them were long
without a tenant, he might at any inadvertent moment
fall into one of them himself. The proverb is capable
of at least two interpretations. It may mean that the
foolish despot, plotting the ruin of his wise servant,
might in his anger go too far; and, betraying his intention,
provoke a retaliative anger before which he himself
would fall. Or it may mean that, should the wise
servant seek to undermine the throne of the despot, he
might be taken in his treachery and bring on himself
the whole weight of the tyrant's wrath.</p>

<p>The second maxim is, "Whoso breaketh down a wall,
a serpent shall bite him" (ver. 8); and here, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the allusion is to the fact that snakes infect the crannies
of old walls (comp. Amos v. 19). To set about dethroning
a tyrant was like pulling down such a wall; you
would break up the nest of many a reptile, many a
venomous hanger-on, and might only get bit or stung
for your pains. Or, again, in pulling out the stones
of an old wall, you might let one of them fall on your
foot; and in hacking out its timbers, you might cut
yourself: that is to say, even if your conspiracy did
not involve you in absolute ruin, it would be only too
likely to do you serious and lasting injury (ver. 9).</p>

<p>The next adage runs (ver. 10), "If the axe be blunt,
and he do not whet the edge, he must put on more
strength, but wisdom should teach him to sharpen it,"
and is, perhaps, the most difficult passage in the Book.
The Hebrew is read in a different way by almost every
translator. As I read it, it means, in general, that it
is not well to work with blunt tools when by a little
labour and delay you may whet them to a keener edge.
Read thus, the political rule implied in it is, "Do not
attempt any great enterprise, any revolution or reform,
till you have a well-considered scheme to go upon, and
suitable instruments to carry it out with." But the
special political import of it may be, "Your strength
is nothing to that of the tyrant; do not therefore lift
a blunt axe against the trunk of despotism: wait till
you have put a sharp edge upon it." Or, the tyrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
himself may be the blunt axe, and then the warning
is, "Sharpen <i>him</i> up, repair him, use him and his
caprices to serve your end; get your way by giving
way to him, and by skilfully availing yourself of his
varying moods." Which of these may be the true
meaning of this obscure disputed passage, I do not
undertake to say; but the latter of the two seems to
be sustained by the adage which follows: "If the
serpent bite because it is not charmed, there is no
advantage to the charmer." For here, I think, there
can be little doubt that the foolish angry ruler is the
serpent, and the wise functionary the charmer who is
to extract the venom of his anger. Let the foolish
ruler be never so furious, the poor wise man, who is
able "to cull the plots of best advantages," and to save
a city, can surely devise a charm of soft submissive
words which will turn away his wrath; just as the
serpent-charmer of the East, by song and incantation,
is at least reputed to draw serpents from their lurk,
that he may pluck the venom from their teeth (ver. 11).
For, as we are told in the very next verse, "the words
of the wise man's mouth win him grace, while the lips
of the fool destroy him."</p>

<p>And on this hint, on this casual mention of his name,
the Preacher&mdash;who all this while, remember, is personating
the sagacious man of the world, bent on rising
to wealth, power, distinction&mdash;once more "comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
down" on the fool. He speaks of him with a burning
heat and contempt, as men versed in public affairs are
wont to do, since they best know how much harm a
voluble, impudent, self-conceited fool may do, how much
good he may prevent. Here, then, is the fool of public
life. He is a man always prating and predicting,
although his words, only foolish at the first, swell and
fret into a malignant madness before he has done, and
although he of all men is least able to give good counsel,
to seize occasions as they rise, or to foresee what is
about to come to pass. Puffed up by the conceit of
wisdom or of his own importance, he is for ever intermeddling
with great affairs, though he has no notion
how to handle them, and is incapable of even finding
his way along the beaten road which leads to the capital
city, of taking and keeping the plain and obvious path
which the exigencies of the time require; while (ver. 3)
he is forward to cry, "There goes a fool," of every
man who is wiser than himself (vv. 12-15). If he
would only hold his tongue, he might pass muster;
beguiled by his gravity and silence, men might give
him credit for sagacity, and fit his foolish deeds with
profound motives; but he <i>will</i> speak, and his words
betray and "swallow him up." Of course <i>we</i> have no
such fools, "full of words," to rise in their high place
and wag their tongues to their own hurt; they are
peculiar to Antiquity or to the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>But <i>then</i> there were so many of them, and their
influence in the State was so disastrous that, as the
Preacher thinks of them, he breaks into an almost
dithyrambic fervour, and cries, "Woe to thee, O land,
when thy king is a child,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and thy princes feast in the
morning! Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is
noble, and thy princes eat at due hours, for strength
and not for revelry!" Through the sloth and riot of
these foolish rulers, the whole fabric of the State was
fast fading into decay&mdash;the roof rotting and the rain
leaking in. To support their inopportune and profligate
revelry, they imposed crushing taxes on the people,
which inspired in some a revolutionary discontent, and
in some the apathy of despair. The Wise Exile foresaw
that the end of a despotism so unjust and luxurious
could not be far off; that when the storm rose and the
wind blew, the ancient House, unrepaired in its decay,
would topple on the heads of those who sat in its halls,
revelling in a wicked mirth (vv. 16-19). Meantime,
the sagacious servant of the State, perchance too of
foreign extraction, unable to arrest the progress of
decay, or not caring how soon it was consummated,
would make his "market of the time;" he would carry
himself warily: and, because the whole land was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
infested with the spies bred by despotism, he would
give them no hold on him, nor so much as speak the
simple truth of his foolish debauched rulers in the
privacy of his own bed-chamber, or mutter his thoughts
on the roof, lest some "bird of the air should carry
the report" (ver. 20).</p>

<p>But if this were the condition of the time, if to rise
in public life involved so many mean crafts and submissions,
so many deadly imminent risks from spies
and from fools clad in a little brief authority, how could
any man hope to find the Chief Good in it? Wisdom
did not always win promotion; virtue was inimical to
success. The anger of an incapable idiot, or the
whisper of an envious rival, or the caprice of a merciless
despot, might at any moment undo the work of
years, and expose the most upright and sagacious of
men to the worst extremities of misfortune. There
was no tranquillity, no freedom, no security, no dignity
in such a life as this. Till this were resigned and
some nobler, loftier aim found, there was no chance of
reaching that great satisfying Good which lifts man
above all accidents, and fixes him in a happy security
from which no blow of Circumstance can dislodge
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>But in a wise
Use and a wise

Life</i>,
Ch. xi., vv. 1-8.</div>

<p>What that Good is, and where it may be found, the
Preacher now proceeds to show. But, as his manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
is, he does not say in so many words, "This is the
Chief Good of man," or "You will find
it yonder;" but he places before us the
man who is walking in the right path and
drawing closer and closer to it. Even of
him the preacher does not give us any
formal description; but, following what we have seen
to be his favourite method, he gives us a string of
maxims and counsels from which we are to infer what
manner of man he is who happily achieves this great
Quest.</p>

<p>And, at the very outset, we learn that this happy
person is of a noble, unselfish, generous temper. Unlike
the man who simply wants to get on and make a
fortune, he grudges no man his gains; he looks on his
neighbours' interests as well as his own, and does
good even to the evil and the unthankful.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He is one
who "casts his bread upon the waters" (ch. xi., ver. 1),
and who "gives a portion thereof to seven, and even
to eight" (ver. 2). The familiar proverb of the first
verse has long been read as an allusion to the sowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of rice and other grain from a boat, during the periodical
inundation of certain Eastern rivers, especially the
Nile. We have been taught to regard the husbandman
pushing from the embanked village in his frail bark, to
cast the grain he would gladly eat on the surface of
the flood, as a type of Christian labour and charity.
He denies himself; so also must we if we would do
good. He has faith in the Divine laws, and trusts to
receive his own again with usury, to reap a larger crop
the longer he waits for it; and, in like manner, we are
to trust in the Divine laws which bring us a hundredfold
for every act of self-denying service, and bless our
"long patience" with the ampler harvest. But it is
doubtful whether the Hebrew <i>usus loquendi</i> admits of
this interpretation. It probably suggests another which,
if unfamiliar to us, has a beauty of its own. In the
East bread is commonly made in thin flat cakes, something
like Passover cakes; and one of these cakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
flung on the stream, though it would float with the
current for a time, would soon sink; and once sunk
would, unlike the grain cast from the boat, yield no
return. And our charity should be like that. We
should do good, "hoping for nothing again." We
should show kindnesses which will soon be forgotten,
never be returned, and be undismayed by the thanklessness
of the task. It is not so thankless as it seems.
For, first, we shall "find the good of it" in the loftier,
more generous temper which the habit of doing good
breeds and confirms. If no one else be the better for
our kindness, we shall be the better, because the more
kindly, for it. The quality of charity, like that of
mercy, is twice blessed;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."</span>
</div>

<p>And, again, the task is not so thankless as it sometimes
seems; for though many of our kind deeds may quicken
no kindness in "him that takes," yet some of them
will; and the more we help and succour the more
likely are we to light upon at least a few who, when
our need comes, will succour and console us. Even
the most hardened have a certain tenderness for those
who help them, if only the help meet a real need, and
be given with grace. And, therefore, we may be very
sure that if we give a portion of our bread to seven
and even to eight, especially if they know that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ourselves have stomach for it all, at least one or two
of them will share with us when we need bread.</p>

<p>But is not this, after all, only a refined selfishness?
If we give because we do not know how soon we may
need a gift, and in order that we may by-and-bye
"find the good of it," do not even the heathen and the
publicans the same? Well, not many of them, I think.
I have not observed that it is their habit to cast their
bread on thankless waters. If they forbode calamity
and loss, they provide against them, not by giving,
but by hoarding; and even they themselves would
hardly accept as a model of charity a man who buttoned
up his pocket against every appeal, lest he should
be yielding to a selfish motive, or be suspected of it.
The refined selfishness of showing kindness and doing
good even to the evil and the unthankful because we
hope to find the good of it is by no means too common
yet; we need not go in dread of it. Nor is it an
altogether unworthy motive. St. Paul urges us to help
a fallen brother on the express ground that we may
need similar help some day (Gal. vi. 1); and <i>he</i> was
not in the habit of appealing to base motives. Nay,
the very Golden Rule itself, which all men admire even
if they do not walk by it, touches this spring of action;
for among other meanings it surely has this, that we
are to do to others as we would that they should do to
us, in the hope that they will do to us as we have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to them. There are other higher meanings in the Rule
of course, as there are other and purer motives for
Charity; but I do not know that we are any of us of
so lofty a virtue that we need fear to show kindness
in order to win kindness, or to give help that we may
get help when we need it. Possibly, to act on this
motive may be the best and nearest way of rising to
such higher motives as we can reach.</p>

<p>The first characteristic, then, of the man who is
likely to achieve the Quest of the Chief Good is the
Charity which prompts him to be gracious, and to show
kindness, and to do good, even to the thankless and
ungracious. And his second characteristic is the stedfast
Industry which turns all seasons to account. The
man of affairs, who wants to rise, waits on occasion;
he is on the watch to avail himself of the moods and
caprices of men and bend them to his interest. But he
who has learned to value things at their true worth,
and whose heart is fixed on the acquisition of the
highest good, does not want to get on so much as to
do his duty under all the variable conditions of life.
Just as he will not withhold his hand from giving, lest
some of the recipients of his charity should prove unworthy,
so also he will not withdraw his hand from the
labour appointed him, because this or that endeavour
may be unproductive, or lest it should be thwarted by
the ordinances of Heaven. He knows that the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Nature will hold on their way, often causing individual
loss to promote the general good. He knows, for instance,
that when the clouds are full of rain they <i>will</i>
empty themselves upon the earth, even though they put
his harvest in peril; and that when the wind is fierce
it will blow down trees, even though it should also
scatter the seed which he is sowing. But he does not
therefore wait upon the wind till it is too late to sow,
nor upon the clouds till his ungathered crops rot in the
fields. He is conscious that, though he knows much,
he knows little of these as of other works of God: he
cannot tell whether this or that tree will be blown
down; almost all he can be certain of is that, when
the tree is down, it will lie where it has fallen, lifting
its bleeding roots in dumb protest against the wind
which has brought it low. But <i>this</i> too he knows,
that it is "God who worketh all;" that <i>he</i> is not responsible
for events beyond his control: that what he
is responsible for is that he do the duty of the moment
whatever wind may blow, and calmly leave the issue
in the hand of God. And so he is not "over exquisite
to cast the fashion of uncertain evils;" diligent and
undismayed, he goes on his way, giving himself heartily
to the present duty, "sowing his seed morning and
evening, although he cannot tell which shall prosper,
this or that, or whether both shall prove good" (vv. 3-6).
Windy March cannot blow him from his constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
purpose, though it may blow the seed out of his hand;
nor a rainy August melt him to despairing tears, though
it may damage his harvest. He has done his duty,
discharged his responsibility: let God see to the rest;
whatever pleases God will content him.</p>

<p>This man, then, has learned one or two of the profoundest
secrets of Wisdom, plain as they look. He
has learned that, giving, we gain; and, spending,
thrive. He has also learned that a man's true care is
himself; that all that pertains to the body, to the issues
of labour, to the chances of fortune, is external to himself;
that whatever form these may take, he may learn
from them, and profit by them, and be content in them:
that his true business in the world is to cultivate a
strong and dutiful character which shall prepare him
for any world or any fate; and that so long as he can
do this, his main duty will be done, his ruling object
attained. <i>Totum in co est, ut tibi imperes.</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Is not this true wisdom? is it not an abiding good?
Pleasures may bloom and fade. Speculations may
shift and change. Riches may come and go&mdash;what
else have they wings for? The body may sicken or
strengthen. The favour of men may be conferred and
withdrawn. There is no stability in these; and if we
are dependent on them, we shall be variable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
inconstant as they are. But if we make it our chief aim
to do our duty whatever it may be, and to love and serve
our neighbour whatever the attitude he may assume to
us, we have an aim always within our reach, a duty
we may always be doing, a good as enduring as ourselves,
and therefore a good we may enjoy for ever.
Standing on this rock, from which no wave of change
can sweep us, "the light will be sweet to us, and it
shall be pleasant to our eyes to behold the sun," whatever
the day, or the world, on which he may rise (ver. 7).</p>

<p>But is all our life to be taken up in meeting the
claims of Duty and of Charity? Are we never to relax
into mirth, never to look forward to a time in which
reward will be more exactly adjusted to service? Yes,
we are to do both this and that. It is very true that
he who makes it his ruling aim to do the present duty,
and to leave the future with God, will have a happy
because a useful life. He that walks this path of duty</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i6">"only thirsting</span>
<span class="i0">For the right, and learns to deaden</span>
<span class="i0">Love of self, before his journey closes,</span>
<span class="i0">He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting</span>
<span class="i0">Into glossy purples, which outredden</span>
<span class="i0">All voluptuous garden roses."</span>
</div>

<p>The path may often be steep and difficult; it may be
overhung with threatening rocks and strewn with
"stones of offence;" but he who pursues it, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
pressing on "through the long gorge" and winning
his way upward,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Shall find the toppling crags of Duty scaled,</span>
<span class="i0">Are close upon the shining table-lands</span>
<span class="i0">To which our God Himself is sun and moon."</span>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, if his life is to be full and complete, he
must be able to pluck whatever bright flowers of joy
spring beside his path, to find "laughing waters" in
the crags he climbs, and to rejoice not only in "the
glossy purples" of the armed and stubborn thistle, but
in the delicate beauty of the ferns, the pure grace of
the cyclamens, and the sweet breath of the fragrant
grasses and flowers which haunt those severe heights.
If he is to be a Man, rather than a Stoic or an Anchorite,
he must add to his sense of duty a keen delight in all
beauty, all grace, all innocent and noble pleasure. For
the sake of others, too, as well as for his own sake, he
must carry with him "the merry heart which doeth
good like a medicine," since, lacking that, he will neither
do all the good he might, nor himself become perfect
and complete. And it is proof, I think, of the good
divinity, no less than of the broad humanity, of the
Preacher that he lays much stress on this point. He
not only bids us enjoy life, but gives us cogent reasons
for enjoying it. "Even," he says, "if a man should
live many years, he ought to enjoy them all." But
why? "Because there will be many dark days," days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of old age and growing infirmity in which pleasures
will lose their charm; days of death through which he
will sleep quietly in the dark stillness of the grave,
beyond the touch of any happy excitement (ver. 8).
Therefore the man who attains the Chief Good will not
only do the duty of the moment; he will also enjoy the
pleasure of the moment. <i>He</i> will not toil through the
long day of life till, spent and weary, he has no power
to enjoy his "much goods," or no time for his soul to
"make merry the glad." While he is "a young man,"
he will "rejoice in his youth, and let his heart cheer
him," and go after the pleasures which attract youth
(ver. 9). While his heart is still fresh, when pleasures
are most innocent and healthful, easiest of attainment
and unalloyed by anxiety and care, he will cultivate
that cheerful temper which is a prime safeguard
against vice, discontent, and the morose fretfulness of a
selfish old age.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Combined with a
stedfast Faith
in the Life to
come.</i>
Ch. x., v. 9-Ch.
xii, v. 7.</div>

<p>But, soft; is not our man of men becoming a mere
man of pleasure? No; for he recognises the claims
of Duty and of Charity. These keep his
pleasures sweet and wholesome, prevent
them from usurping the whole man, and
landing him in the satiety and weariness
of dissipation. But lest even these safeguards
should prove insufficient, he has also this: he
knows that "God will bring him into judgment;" that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
all his works, whether of charity or duty or recreation,
will be weighed in the pure and even balance of Divine
Justice (ver. 9). <i>This</i> is the secret of the pure heart&mdash;the
heart that is kept pure amid all labours and cares
and joys. But the intention of the Preacher in thus
adverting to the Divine Judgment has been gravely
misconstrued, wrested even to its very opposite. We
too much forget what that Judgment must have seemed
to the enslaved Jews;&mdash;how weighty a consolation,
how bright a hope! They were captive exiles, oppressed
by profligate despotic lords. Cleaving to the Divine
Law with a passionate loyalty such as they had never
felt in happier days, they were nevertheless exposed to
the most dire and constant misfortunes. All the blessings
which the Law pronounced on the obedient seemed
withheld from them, all its promises of good and peace
to be falsified; the wicked triumphed over them, and
prospered in their wickedness. Now to a people whose
convictions and hopes had suffered this miserable
defeat, what truth would be more welcome than that
of a life to come, in which all wrongs should be both
righted and avenged, and all the promises in which they
had hoped should receive a large fulfilment that would
beggar hope? what prospect could be more cheerful
and consolatory than that of a day of retribution on
which their oppressors would be put to shame, and
<i>they</i> would be recompensed for their fidelity to the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of God? This hope would be sweeter to them than
any pleasure; it would lend a new zest to every pleasure,
and make them more zealous in good works.</p>

<p>Nay, we know, from the Psalms composed during the
Captivity, that the judgment of God <i>was</i> an incentive
to hope and joy; that, instead of fearing it, the pious
Jews looked forward to it with rapture and exultation.
What, for example, can be more riant and joyful than
the concluding strophe of Psalm xcvi.?</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;</span>
<span class="i0">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;</span>
<span class="i0">Let the field exult and all that therein is;</span>
<span class="i0">And let all the trees of the wood sing for joy</span>
<span class="i0">Before Jehovah: for He cometh,</span>
<span class="i0">For He cometh <i>to judge the earth,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To judge the world with righteousness</i>,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the peoples with his truth</i>;</span>
</div>

<p>or than the third strophe of Psalm xcviii.?</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;</span>
<span class="i0">The world, and they that dwell therein;</span>
<span class="i0">Let the floods clap their hands,</span>
<span class="i0">And let the hills sing for joy together</span>
<span class="i0">Before Jehovah: <i>for He cometh to judge the earth</i>;</span>
<span class="i0"><i>With righteousness shall He judge the world</i>,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the peoples with equity</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>It is impossible to read these verses, and such verses
as these, without feeling that the Jews of the Captivity
anticipated the Divine Judgment, not with fear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
dread, but with a hope and joy so deep and keen as
that they summoned the whole round of Nature to
share in it and reflect it.</p>

<p>If we remembered this, we should not so readily
agree with the Preachers and Commentators who
assume Coheleth to be speaking ironically in this verse,
and as though he would defy his readers to enjoy their
pleasures with the thought of God and his judgment
of them in their minds. We should rather understand
that he was making life more cheerful to them; that
he was removing the blight of despair which had fallen
on it; that he was kindling in their dreary prospect
a light which would shine even into their darkened
present with gracious and healing rays. All wrongs
would be easier to bear, all duties would be faced with
better heart, all alleviating pleasures would grow more
welcome, if once they were fully persuaded that there
was a life beyond death, a life in which the good would
be "comforted" and the evil "tormented." It is on
the express ground that there is a Judgment that the
Preacher, in the last verse of this chapter, bids them
banish "care" and "sadness," or, as the words perhaps
mean, "moroseness" and "trouble;" though he
also adds another reason which no longer afflicts him
much, viz., that "youth and manhood are vanity," soon
gone, never to be recalled, and never enjoyed if the
brief occasion is suffered to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>Mark how quickly the force of this great hope has
reversed his position. Only in ver. 8, the very instant
before he discloses his hope, he urges men to enjoy
the present "because all that is coming is vanity,"
because there were so many dark days, days of infirm
querulous age and silent dreary death before them.
But here, in ver. 10, the very moment he has disclosed
his hope, he urges them to enjoy the present,
not because <i>the future</i> is vanity, but because <i>the present</i>
is vanity, because youth and manhood soon pass and
the pleasures proper to them will be out of reach. Why
should they any longer be fretted with care and anxiety
when the lamp of Revelation shone so brightly on the
future? Why should they not be cheerful when so
happy a prospect lay before them? Why should they
sit brooding over their wrongs when their wrongs were
so soon to be righted, and they were to enter on so
ample a recompense of reward? Why should they not
travel toward a future so welcome and inviting with
hearts attuned to mirth and responsive to every touch
of pleasure?</p>

<p>But is the thought of Judgment to be no check on
our pleasures? Well, it is certainly used here as an
incentive to pleasure, to cheerfulness. We are to
be happy <i>because</i> we are to stand at the bar of God,
because in the Judgment He will adjust and compensate
all the wrongs and afflictions of time. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
not every one who can take to himself the full comfort
of this argument. Only he can do that who makes it
his ruling aim to do his duty and help his neighbour.
And no doubt even he will find the hope of judgment&mdash;for
with him it is a hope rather than a fear&mdash;a
valuable check, not on his pleasures, but on those base
counterfeits which often pass for pleasures, and which
betray men, through voluptuousness, into satiety, disgust,
remorse. Because he hopes to meet God, and has
to give account of himself to God, he will resist the evil
lusts which pollute and degrade the soul: and thus
the prospect of Judgment will become a safeguard and
a defence.</p>

<p>But he has a safeguard of even a more sovereign
potency than this. For he not only looks forward to a
future judgment, he is conscious of a present and constant
judgment. God is with him wherever he goes.
From "the days of his youth" he has "remembered his
Creator" (chap. xii., ver. 1). He has remembered <i>Him</i>,
and given to the poor and needy. He has remembered
Him and, doing all things as to Him, duty has grown
light. He has remembered Him, and his pleasures
have grown the sweeter because they were gifts from
Heaven, and because he has taken them, in a thankful
spirit, for a temperate enjoyment. Of all safeguards to
a life of virtue, this is the noblest and the best. We
can afford, indeed, to part with none of them, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
are strangely weak, often where we least suspect it,
and need all the helps we can get: but least of all can
we afford to part with this. We need to remember that
every sin is punished here and now, inwardly if not
outwardly, and that these inward punishments are the
most severe. We need to remember that we must all
appear before the judgment-seat of God, to render an
account of the deeds done in the body. But above all&mdash;if
love, and not fear, is to be the animating motive of
our life&mdash;we need to remember that God is always with
us, observing what we do; and that, not that He may
spy upon us and accumulate heavy charges against us,
but that He may help us to do well; not to frown
upon our pleasures, but to hallow, deepen, and prolong
them, and to be Himself our Chief Good and our
Supreme Delight.</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, the Preacher enforces this early and habitual
reference of the soul to the Divine Presence and Will
by a brief allusion to the impotence and weariness of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
godless old age, and by a very striking description of
the terrors of the death in which it culminates.</p>

<p>While "the dew of youth" is still fresh upon us
we are to "remember our Creator" and his constant
judgment of us lest, forgetting Him, we should waste
our powers in sensual excess; lest temperate mirth
should degenerate into an extravagant and wanton
devotion to pleasure; lest the lust of mere physical
enjoyment should outlive the power to enjoy, and,
groaning under the penalties our unbridled indulgence
has provoked, we should find "days of evil" rise on
us in long succession, and draw out into "years" of
fruitless desire, self-disgust, and despair (ver. 1).
"Before the evil days come," and that they may not
come; before "the years arrive of which we shall say,
I have no pleasure in them," and that they may not
arrive, we are to bethink us of the Pure and Awful
Presence in which we daily stand. God is with us
that we may not sin; with us in youth, that "the
angel of his Presence" may save us from the sins to
which youth is prone; with us, to save us from "the
noted slips of youth and liberty," that our closing
years may have the cheerful serenity of a happy old
age.</p>

<p>To this admonition drawn from the miseries of godless
age, the Preacher appends a description of the
terrors of approaching death (vv. 2-5),&mdash;a description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
which has suffered many strange torments at the hands
of critics and commentators. It has commonly been
read as an allegorical, but singularly accurate, diagnosis
of "the disease men call death," as setting forth
in graphic figures the gradual decay of sense after
sense, faculty after faculty.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Learned physicians have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
written treatises upon it, and have been lost in admiration
of the force and beauty of the metaphors in which
it conveys the results of their special science, although
they differ in their interpretation of almost every sentence,
and are driven at times to the most gross and
absurd conjectures in order to sustain their several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
theories. I need not give any detailed account of
these speculations, for the simple reason that they are
based, as I believe, on an entire misconception of the
Sacred Text. Instead of being, as has been assumed, a
figurative description of the dissolution of the body, it
sets forth the threatening approach of death under the
image of a tempest which, gathering over an Eastern
city during the day, breaks upon it toward evening:
so, at least, I, with many more, take it. And I do not
know how we can better arrive at it than by considering
what would be the incidents which would strike us
if we were to stroll through the narrow tortuous streets
of such a city as the day was closing in.</p>

<p>As we passed along we should find small rows of
houses and shops, broken here and there by a wide
stretch of blank wall, behind which were the mansions,
harems, courtyards of its wealthier inhabitants. Round
and within the low narrow gates which gave access to
these mansions, we should see armed men lounging
whose duty it is to guard the premises against robbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and intruders; these are "the keepers of the house,"
over whom, as over the whole household, are placed
superior officials&mdash;members of the family often&mdash;or
"men of power." Going through the gates and glancing
up at the latticed windows, we might catch glimpses
of the veiled faces of the ladies of the house who, not
being permitted to stir abroad except on rare occasions
and under jealous guardianship, are accustomed to
amuse their dreary leisure, and to learn a little of
what is going on around them, by "looking out of the
windows." Within the house, the gentlemen of the
family would be enjoying the chief meal of the day,
provoking appetite with delicacies such as "the
locust,"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> or condiments such as "the caper-berry,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
or with choice fruit such as "the almond."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Above
all the shrill cries and noises of the city you would
hear a loud humming sound rising on every side, for
which you would be sorely puzzled to account if you
were a stranger to Eastern habits. It is the sound
of the cornmills which, towards evening, are at work
in every house. A cornmill was indispensable to every
Eastern family, since there were no public mills or
bakers except the King's. The heat of the climate
makes it necessary that corn should be ground and
bread baked every day. And as the task of grinding
at the mill was very irksome, only the most menial
class of women, often slaves or captives, were employed
upon it. Of course the noise caused by the revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of the upper upon the nether millstone was very great
when the mills were simultaneously at work in every
house in the city. No sound is more familiar in the
East; and, if it were suddenly stopped, the effect would
be as striking as the sudden stoppage of all the wheels
of traffic in an English town. So familiar was the
sound, indeed, and of such good omen, that in Holy
Writ it is used as a symbol of a happy, active, well-provided
people; while the cessation of it is employed
to denote want, and desolation, and despair. To an
Oriental ear no threat would be more doleful and
pathetic than that in Jeremiah (xxv. 10), "I will take
from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the
bride, <i>the sound of the millstones</i>, and the light of the
candle."</p>

<p>Now suppose the day on which we rambled through
the city had been boisterous and lowering; that heavy
rain had fallen, obscuring all the lights of heaven; and
as the evening drew on, the thick clouds, instead
of dispersing, had "returned after the rain," so that
setting sun and rising moon, and the growing light of
stars, were all blotted from view (ver. 2). The tempest,
long in gathering, breaks on the city; the lightnings
flash through the darkness, making it more hideous;
the thunder crashes and rolls above the roofs; the
tearing rain beats at all lattices and floods all roads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
If we cared to abide the pelting of the storm, we should
have before us the very scene which the Preacher
depicts. "The keepers of the house," the guards and
porters, would quake. "The men of power," the lords
or owners of the house, or the officials who most closely
attended on them, would crouch and tremble with
apprehension. The maids at the mill would "stop"
because one or other of the two women&mdash;two at least&mdash;whom
it took to work the heavy millstone had been
frightened from her task by the gleaming lightning and
the pealing thunder. The ladies, looking out of their
lattices, would be driven back into the darkest corners
of the inner rooms of the harem. Every door would be
closed and barred lest robbers, availing themselves of
the darkness and its terrors, should creep in (ver. 3).
"The noise of the mills" would grow faint or utterly
cease, because the threatening tumult had terrified
many, if not all, the grinding-maids from their work.
The strong-winged "swallow," lover of wind and
tempest, would flit to and fro with shrieks of joy;
while the delicate "song-birds" would drop, silent and
alarmed, into their nests. The gentlemen of the house
would soon lose all gust for their delicate cates<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and
fruits; "the almond" would be pushed aside, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
locust loathed," and even the stimulating "caper-berry
provoke no appetite," fear being a singularly unwelcome
and disappetising guest at a feast. In short, the
whole people, stunned and confused by the awful and
stupendous majesty of a tropical storm, would be
affrighted at the terrors which come flaming from
"the height" of heaven, to confront them on every
highway (vv. 4, 5).</p>

<p>Such and so terrible is the tempest that at times
sweeps over an Eastern city.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Such and so terrible,
adds the Preacher, is death to the godless and sensual.
They are carried away as by a storm; the wind riseth
and snatcheth them out of their place. For if we ask,
"Why, O Preacher, has your pencil laboured to depict
the terrors of a tempest?" he replies, "Because man
goeth to his long home, and the mourners pace up and
down the street" (ver. 5). He leaves us in no doubt
as to the moral of the fable, the theme and motive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
his picture. While painting it, while adding touch to
touch, he has been thinking of "the long home"&mdash;or,
as the Hebrew has it, "the house of eternity;" a
phrase still used by the Jews as a synonym for "the
grave"&mdash;which is appointed for all living, and of the
mercenary professional mourners who loiter under the
windows of the dying man in the hope that they may
be hired to lament him. To the expiring sinner death
is simply dreadful. It puts an end to all his activities
and enjoyments, just as the tempest brings all the
labours and recreations of the city to a pause. He has
nothing before him but the grave, and none to mourn
him but the harpies who already pace the street, longing
for the moment when he will be gone, and who value
their fee far above his life. If we would have death
shorn of its terrors for us, we must "remember our
Creator" before death comes; we must seek by charity,
by a faithful discharge of duty, by a wise use and a
wise enjoyment of the life that now is, to prepare ourselves
for the life which is to come.</p>

<p>Death itself, as Coheleth proceeds to remind us
(ver. 6), cannot be escaped. Some day the cord <i>will</i>
break and the lamp fall; some day the jar or pitcher
must be broken, and the wheel, shattered, fall into the
well. Death is the common event. It befalls not only
the sinful and injurious, but also the useful and the
good. Our life may have been like a "golden" lamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
suspended by a silver chain, fit for the palace of a king,
and may have shed a welcome and cheerful light on
every side and held out every promise of endurance
but, none the less, the costly durable chain will be
snapped at last, and the fair costly bowl be broken. Or
our life may have been like the "pitcher" dipped, by
village maidens, into the village fountain; or, again,
like "the wheel" by which water is drawn, by a
thousand hands, from the city well; it may have conveyed
a vital refreshment to the few or to the many
around us: but, none the less, the day must come when
the pitcher will be shattered on the edge of the fountain,
and the time-worn wheel fall from its rotten supports.
There is no escape from death. And, therefore, as we
must all die, let us all live as cheerfully and helpfully
as we can; let us all prepare for the better life beyond
the grave, by serving our Creator before "the body is
cast into the earth from which it came, and the spirit
returns to God who gave it" (ver. 7).</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This, then, according to the Hebrew Preacher, is
the ideal man, the man who achieves the Quest of the
Chief Good:&mdash;Charitable, dutiful, cheerful, he prepares
for death by a useful and happy life, for future
judgment by a constant reference to the present
judgment, for meeting God hereafter by walking with
Him here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>Has he not achieved the Quest? Can we hope to
find a more solid and enduring Good? What to him
are the shocks of Change, the blows of Circumstance,
the mutations of Time, the fluctuations of Fortune?
These cannot touch the Good which he holds to be
Chief. If they bring trouble, he can bear trouble
and profit by it: if they bring prosperity, success,
mirth, he can bear even these, and neither value them
beyond their worth nor abuse them to his hurt; for
his Good, and therefore his peace and blessedness, are
founded on a Rock over which the changeful waves
may wash, but against which they cannot prevail. Let
the sun shine never so hotly, let the storm beat never
so furiously, the Rock stands firm, and the house which
he has built for himself upon the Rock. Whatever
may befall, he can be doing his main work, enjoying
his supreme satisfaction, since he can meet all changes
with a dutiful and loving heart; since, through all, he
may be forming a noble character and helping his
neighbours to form a character as noble as his own.
Because he has a gracious God always with him, and
because a bright future stretches before him in endless
and widening vistas of hope, he can carry to all the
wrongs and afflictions of time a cheerful spirit which
shines through them with transfiguring rays,&mdash;a spirit
before which even the thick darkness of death will grow
light, and the solemnities of the Judgment be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
into holiday festivity and a triumph. Ah, foolish and
miserable that we are who, with so noble a life,
and so bright a prospect, and a Good so enduring
open to us&mdash;and with such helps to them in the Gospel
of Christ as Coheleth could not know&mdash;nevertheless
creep about the earth the slaves of every accident, the
very fools of Time!</p>

<h2>THE EPILOGUE.</h2>

<h3><i>IN WHICH THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK IS
CONCLUSIVELY SOLVED.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chap. XII., Vers. 8-14.</span></p>


<p>"Students," says the Talmud, "are of four kinds;
they are like a sponge, a funnel, a strainer, and
a sieve: like a sponge that sucketh all up; like a
funnel which receiveth at one end and dischargeth at
the other; like a strainer which letteth the wine pass
but retaineth the lees; and like a sieve which dischargeth
the bran but retaineth the corn." Coheleth
is like the sieve. He is the good student who has
sifted all the schemes and ways and aims of men,
separating the wheat from the bran, teaching us to
know the bran as bran, the wheat as wheat. It is a
true "corn of heaven" which he offers us, and not
any of the husks to obtain which reckless and prodigal
man has often wasted his whole living&mdash;husks which,
though they have the form and hue of wheat, have
not its nutriment, and cannot therefore satisfy the
keen hunger of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>We have now followed the sifting process to its
close; much bran lies about our feet, but a little corn
is in our hands, and from this little there may grow
"a harvest unto life." Starting in quest of that Chief
Good in which, when once it is attained, we can rest
with an unbroken and measureless content, we have
learned that it is not to be found in Wisdom, in
Pleasure, in Devotion to Business or Public Affairs, in
a modest Competence or in boundless Wealth. We
have learned that only he achieves this supreme Quest
who is "charitable, dutiful, cheerful;" only he who "by
a wise use and a wise enjoyment of the present life
prepares himself for the life which is to come." We
have learned that the best incentive to this life of virtue,
and its best safeguards, are a constant remembrance
of our Creator and of his perpetual presence with us,
and a constant hope of that future judgment in which
all the wrongs of time are to be redressed. And here
we might think our task was ended. We might suppose
that the Preacher would dismiss us from the
School in which he has so long held us by his sage
maxims, his vivid illustrations, his gracious warnings
and encouragements. But even yet he will not suffer
us to depart. He has still "words to utter for God,"
words which it will be well for us to ponder. As in
the Prologue he had stated the problem he was about
to take in hand, so now he subjoins an Epilogue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
which he re-states the solution of it at which he has
arrived. His last words are, as we should expect
them to be, heavily weighted with thought. So closely
packed are his thoughts and allusions, indeed, as to
give a disconnected and illogical tone to his words.
Every saying seems to stand alone, complete in itself;
and hence our main difficulty in dealing with this
Epilogue is to trace the links of sequence which bind
saying to saying and thought to thought, and so to
get "the best part" of his work. Every verse supplies
a text for patient meditation, or a theme which needs
to be illustrated by historic facts that lie beyond the
general reach; and the danger is lest, while dwelling
on these separate themes and texts, we should fail to
collect their connected meaning, and to grasp the large
conclusion to which they all conduct.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Coheleth commences (ver. 8) by once more striking
the keynote to which all his work is set: "Vanity of
vanities, saith the Preacher, all is vanity!" We are
not, however, to take these words as announcing his
deliberate verdict on the sum of human endeavours and
affairs; for he has now discovered the true abiding
Good which underlies all the vanities of earth and
time. His repetition of this familiar phrase is simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a touch of art by which the Poet reminds us of what
the main theme of his Poem has been, of the pain and
weariness and disappointment which have attended his
long Quest. As it falls once more, and for the last
time, on our ear, we cannot but remember how often,
and in what connections, we have heard it before.
Memory and imagination are set to work. The whole
course of the sacred drama passes swiftly before us,
with its mournful pauses of defeated hope, as we listen
to this echo of the despair with which the baffled
Preacher has so often returned from seeking the true
Good in this or that province of human life in which
it was not to be found.</p>

<p>Having thus reminded us of the several stages of
his Quest, and of the verdict which he had been compelled
to pronounce at the close of each but the last,
Coheleth proceeds (ver. 9) to set forth his qualifications
for undertaking this sore task: "Not only was the
Preacher a wise man, he also taught the people wisdom,
and composed, collected, and arranged many proverbs"
or parables, the proverb being a condensed parable and
the parable an expanded proverb. His claims are that
he is a sage, and a public teacher, who has both made
many proverbs of his own, collected the wise sayings of
other sages, and has so arranged them as to convey
a connected and definite teaching to his disciples; and
his motive in setting forth these claims is, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
that he may the more deeply impress upon us the
conclusion to which he has come, and which it has
cost him so much to reach.</p>

<p>Now during the Captivity there was a singular outbreak
of literary activity in the Hebrew race. Even
yet this crisis in their history is little studied and
understood; but we shall only follow the Preacher's
meaning through vv. 9-12 as we read them in the light
of this striking event. That a change of the most
radical and extraordinary kind passed upon the Hebrews
of this period, that they were by some means drawn
to a study of their Sacred Writings much more
thorough and intense than any which went before it,
we know; but of the causes of this change we are not
so well informed.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> A great, and perhaps the greatest,
authority<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> on this subject writes: "One of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
mysterious and momentous periods in the history of
humanity is that brief space of the Exile. What were
the influences brought to bear on the captives during
that time, we know not. But this we know, that from
a reckless, lawless, godless populace, they returned
transformed into a band of Puritans. The religion of
Zerdusht (Zoroaster), though it has left its traces in
Judaism, fails to account for that change.... Yet
the change is there, palpable, unmistakable&mdash;a change
which we may regard as almost miraculous. Scarcely
aware before of their glorious national literature, the
people now began to press round these brands plucked
from the fire&mdash;the scanty records of their faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
history&mdash;with a fierce and passionate love, a love
stronger even than that of wife and child. These
same documents, as they were gradually formed into
a canon, became the immediate centre of their lives,
their actions, their thoughts, their very dreams. From
that time forth, with scarcely any intermission, the
keenest as well as the most poetical minds of the
nation remained fixed upon them."</p>

<p>The more we think of this change, the more the
wonder grows. Good kings and inspired prophets had
desired to see the nation devoted to the Word of the
Lord, had spent their lives in vain endeavours to recall
the thought and affection of their race to the Sacred
Records in which the will of God was revealed. But
what they failed to do was done when the inspiration
of the Almighty was withdrawn and the voice of
Prophecy had grown mute. In their Captivity, under
the strange wrongs and miseries of their exile, the
Jews remembered God their Maker, Giver of songs in
the night. They betook themselves to the study of the
Sacred Oracles. They began to acquaint themselves
with all wisdom that they might define and illustrate
whatever was obscure in the Scriptures of their fathers.
They commenced that elaborate systematic commentary
of which many noble fragments are still extant.
They drew new truths from the old letter, or from the
collocation of scattered passages,&mdash;as, for instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
truths of the immortality of the soul and of the resurrection
of the body. They laid the hidden foundations
of the Synagogues and Schools which afterwards
covered the land. Ezra and Nehemiah, who, by grace
of the Persian conquerors, led them back from Babylonia
to Jerusalem, are still claimed as the founders of the
Great Synagogue, <i>i.e.</i> as the leaders of that great race
of jurists, sages, authors, whose utterances are still a
law in Israel, and of whom the lawyers and the scribes
of the New Testament were the modern successors.
Before the Captivity there was not a term for "school"
in their language; there were at least a dozen in
common use within two or three centuries after the
accession of Cyrus. Education had become compulsory.
Its immense value in the popular estimation is marked
in innumerable sayings such as these: "Jerusalem
was destroyed because the education of the young was
neglected;" "Even for the rebuilding of the Temple
the schools must not be interrupted;" "Study is more
meritorious than sacrifice;" "A scholar is greater than
a prophet;" "You should revere the teacher even
more than your father; the latter only brought you
into this world, the former shews you the way into the
next." To meet the national craving indicated in these
and similar proverbs, innumerable copies of the Sacred
Books, of commentaries, traditions, and the gnomic
utterances of the Wise, were written and circulated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of which, in the Canon, in some of the Apocryphal
Scriptures, in the works of Philo, and in the legal and
legendary sections of the Talmud, many specimens
have come down to us. In fine, whatever was the
cause of this marvellous outburst, there can be no
doubt that the whole Rabbinical period was characterised
by devotion to learning, a mental and literary
activity, much more general and vital than it is easy
for us to conceive.</p>

<p>In such an age the words of a professed and acknowledged
Sage would carry great weight. If, besides
being "a wise man," he was a recognised "teacher," a
man whose wisdom was stamped by public and official
approval, whatever fell from his lips would command
public attention: for these teachers, or rabbis, were the
real rulers of the time, and not the pharisees or the
priests, or even the politicians. They might be, they
often were, "tent-makers, sandal-makers, weavers, carpenters,
tanners, bakers, cooks"; for it is among their
highest claims to our respect that these learned rabbis
reverenced labour, however menial or toilsome, that
they held mere scholarship and piety of little worth
unless conjoined with regular and healthy physical
exertion. But, however toilsome their lives or humble
their circumstances, these wise men were "masters of
the law." It was their special function to interpret the
Law of Moses&mdash;which, remember, was the law of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
land&mdash;to explain its bearing on this case or that, if not,
as many modern critics maintain, to add to its precepts
and codes; and, as members of the local courts or
the metropolitan Sanhedrin, to administer the law they
expounded. An immense power, therefore, was in
their hands. To obey the Law was to be at once
loyal and religious, happy here and hereafter. Hence
the rabbis, whose business it was to apply the law to all
the details of life, and whose decisions were authoritative
and final, could not fail to command universal
deference and respect. They were lawyers, judges,
schoolmasters, heads of colleges, public orators and
lecturers, statesmen and preachers, all in one or
all in turn, and therefore concentrated in themselves
the esteem which we distribute on many offices and
many men.</p>

<p>Such a rabbi was Coheleth. He was of "the
Wise"; he was a "master of the law." And, in addition
to these claims, he was also a teacher and an author
who, besides "composing," had "collected and arranged
many proverbs." Than this latter he could hardly
have any higher claim to the regard, and even to the
affection, of the Hebrew public. The passionate fondness
of Oriental races for proverbs, fables, stories
of any kind, is well known. And the Jews for whom
Coheleth wrote took, as was natural at such a time, an
extraordinary delight, extraordinary even for the East,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in listening to and repeating the wise or witty sayings,
the parables and poems, of their national authors.
Some of these are still in our hands: as we read them,
we cease to wonder at the intense enjoyment with
which they were welcomed by a generation not cloyed,
as we are, with books. They are not only charming
as works of art: they have also this charm, that they
convey lofty ethical instruction. Take a few of these
pictorial proverbs, not included in the Canonical Scriptures.
"The house that does not open to the poor will
open to the physician." "Commit a sin twice, and you
will begin to think it quite allowable." "The reward
of good works is like dates&mdash;sweet, but ripening late."
"Even when the gates of prayer are shut in heaven,
the gate of tears is open." "When the righteous dies,
it is the earth that loses; the lost jewel is still a jewel,
but he who has lost it&mdash;well may he weep." "Who is
wise? He who is willing to learn from all men. Who
is strong? He who subdues his passions. Who is
rich? He that is satisfied with his lot." These are
surely happy expressions of profound moral truths. But
the rabbis are capable of putting a keener edge on their
words; they can utter witty epigrams as incisive as
those of any of our modern satirists, and yet use their
wit in the service of good sense and morality. It would
not be easy to match, it would be very hard to beat,
such sayings as these:&mdash;"The sun will go down without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
<i>your</i> help." "When the ox is <i>down</i>, many are the
butchers." "The soldiers fight, and kings are the
heroes." "The camel wanted horns, and they took
away his ears." "The cock and the owl both wait for
morning: the light brings joy to me, says the cock, but
what are <i>you</i> waiting for?" "When the pitcher falls
on the stone, woe to the pitcher; when the stone falls
on the pitcher, woe to the pitcher: whatever happens,
woe to the pitcher." "Look not at the flask, but at
that which is in it: for there are new flasks full of old
wine, and old flasks which have not even new wine in
them:" ah, of how many of those "old flasks" have
some of us had to drink, or seem to drink! When the
rabbis draw out their moral at greater length, when
they tell a story, their skill does not desert them.
Here is one of the briefest, which can hardly fail to
remind us of more than one of the parables uttered by
the Great Teacher Himself. "There was once a king
who bade all his servants to a great repast, but did not
name the hour. Some went home, and put on their
best garments, and came and stood at the door of the
palace. Others said, 'There is time enough, the king
will let us know beforehand.' But the king summoned
them of a sudden; and those that came in their best
garments were well received, but the foolish ones, who
came in their slovenliness, were turned away in disgrace.
<i>Repent ye to-day, lest ye be summoned to-morrow.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>Is it any wonder that the Jews, even in the sorrows
of their Captivity, liked to hear such proverbs and
parables as these? that they had an immense and
grateful admiration for the men who spent much
thought and care on the composition and arrangement
of these wise, beautiful sayings? Should not we
ourselves be thankful to hear them when the day's
work was done, or even while it was doing? If, then,
such an one as Coheleth&mdash;a sage, a rabbi, a composer
and collector of proverbs and parables&mdash;came to them
and said, "My children, I have sought what you are all
seeking; I have been in quest of that Chief Good which
you still pursue; and I will tell you the story of the
Quest in the parables and proverbs which you are so
fond of hearing:"&mdash;we can surely understand that they
would be charmed to listen, that they would hang upon
his words, that they would be predisposed to accept his
conclusions. As they listened, and found that he was
telling them their own story no less than his, that he was
trying to lead them away from the vanities which they
themselves felt to be vanities, toward an abiding Good
in which he had found rest; as they heard him enforce
the duties of charity, industry, hilarity&mdash;duties which
all their rabbis urged upon them, and invite them to
that wise use and wise enjoyment of the present life
which their own consciences approved: above all, as
he unfolded before them the bright hope of a future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
judgment in which all wrongs would be redressed and
all acts of duty receive a great recompense of reward,&mdash;would
they not hail him as the wisest of their
teachers, as the great rabbi who had achieved the
supreme Quest? Assuredly few books were, or are,
more popular than the book Ecclesiastes. Its presence
and influence may be traced on every subsequent age
and department of Hebrew literature; it has entered
into our English literature hardly less deeply. Many
of its verses are familiar to us as household words, <i>are</i>
household words. Brief as the Book is, I am disposed
to think it is better known among us than any other of
the Old Testament Books except Genesis, the Psalter,
and the prophecies of Isaiah. Job is an incomparably
finer, as it is a much longer poem; but I doubt whether
most of us could not quote at least two verses from the
shorter for every one that we could repeat from the
longer Scripture. We can very easily understand,
therefore, that the Wise Preacher, as he himself
assures us (ver. 10), bestowed on this work much
care and thought; that he had made diligent search
for "words of comfort" by which he might solace
and strengthen the hearts of his oppressed brethren;
and that, having found words of comfort and of
truth, he wrote them down with a frank sincerity and
uprightness.</p>

<p>From this description of the motives which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
impelled him to publish the results of his thought and
experience, and of the spirit in which he had composed
his work, Coheleth passes, in ver. 11, to a description
of the twofold function of the Teacher which is
really a marvellous little poem in itself, a pastoral cut
on a gem. That function is, on the one hand, <i>progressive</i>,
and, on the other hand, <i>conservative</i>. At
times the Teacher's words are like "goads" with which
the herdsmen prick on their cattle to new pastures,
correcting them when they loiter or stray; at other
times they are like the "spikes" which the shepherds
drive into the ground when they pitch their tents on
pastures where they intend to linger: "The words of
<i>the Wise</i> are like goads," he says; and "the Wise"
was a technical term for the sages who interpreted and
administered the law; while "those of <i>the Masters of
the Assemblies</i> are like spikes driven home," "Masters
of Assemblies" being a technical name for the heads
of the colleges and schools which, during the Rabbinical
period, were to be found in every town, and almost
in every hamlet, of Judea. The same man might,
and commonly did, wear both titles; and, probably,
Coheleth was himself both a Wise Man and a Master.
So much as this, indeed, seems implied in the very
name by which he introduces himself in the Prologue.
For Coheleth means, as we have seen, "one who calls
an assembly together and addresses them," <i>i.e.</i> precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
such a wise man as was reckoned the "master
of an assembly" among the Jews.</p>

<p>What did these Masters teach? Everything almost&mdash;at
least everything then known. It is true that
their main function was to interpret and enforce the
law of Moses; but this function demanded all science
for its adequate fulfilment. Take a simple illustration.
The Law said, "Thou shalt not kill." Here, if ever,
is a plain and simple statute, with no ambiguities, no
qualifications, capable neither of misconstruction nor
evasion. Anybody may remember it, and know what
it means. <i>May</i> they? I am not so sure of that. The
Law says I am not to kill. What, not in self-defence!
not to save honour from outrage! not in a patriotic
war! not to save my homestead from the freebooter
or my house from the midnight thief! not when my
kinsman is slain before my eyes and in my defence!
Many similar cases might be mooted, and were mooted,
by the Jews. The Master had to consider such cases
as these, to study the recorded and traditional verdicts
of previous judges, the glosses and comments of other
Masters; he had to lay down rules and to apply rules
to particular and exceptional cases, just as our English
Judges have to define the Common Law or to interpret
a Parliamentary Statute. The growing wants of
the Commonwealth, the increasing complexity of the
relations of life as the people of Israel came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
contact with foreign races, or were carried into captivity
in strange lands, necessitated new laws, new rules of
conduct. And as there was no recognised authority
to issue a decree, no Parliament to pass an Act, the
wise Masters, learned in the law of God, were compelled
to lay down these rules, to extend and qualify
the ancient statutes till they covered modern cases and
wants. Thus in this very Book, Coheleth gives the
rules which should govern a wise and pious Jew in
the new relations of Traffic (ch. iv., vv. 4-16), and in
the service of foreign despots (ch. x., vv. 1-20). For
such contingencies as these the Law made no provision;
and hence the rabbis, who sat in Moses' chair,
made provision for them by legislating in the spirit
of the Law.</p>

<p>Even in the application of known and definite laws
there was need for care, and science, and thought.
"The Mosaic code," says Deutsch, "has injunctions
about the Sabbatical journey; the distance had to be
measured and calculated, and mathematics were called
into play. Seeds, plants, and animals had to be studied
in connection with many precepts regarding them, and
natural history had to be appealed to. Then there
were the purely hygienic paragraphs, which necessitated
for their precision a knowledge of all the medical
science of the time. The seasons and the feast-days
were regulated by the phases of the moon; and astronomy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
if only in its elements, had to be studied." As
the Hebrews came successively into contact with Babylonians,
Persians, Greeks, Romans, the political and
religious systems of these foreign races could not fail
to leave some impressions on their minds, and that
these impressions might not be erroneous and misleading,
it became the Master to acquaint himself with
the results of foreign thought. Nay, "not only was
science, in its widest sense, required of him, but even
an acquaintance with its fantastic shadows, such as
astrology, magic, and the rest, in order that, both as
lawgiver and judge, he might be able to enter into
the popular feeling about these 'arts,'" and wisely
control it.</p>

<p>The proofs that this varied knowledge was acquired
and patiently applied to the study of the Law by these
"masters in Israel" are still with us in many learned
sayings and essays of that period; and in all these the
<i>conservative</i> element or temper is sufficiently prominent.
Their leading aim was, obviously, to honour the law
of Moses; to preserve its spirit even in the new rules
or codes which the changed circumstances of the time
imperatively required; to fix their stakes and pitch
their tents in the old fields of thought. So obvious is
this aim, even in the familiar pages of the New Testament,
that I need not illustrate it.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the signs of <i>progress</i> are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
less decisive, though we may be less familiar with them.
Through all this mass of learned and deferential comment
on the Mosaic Code, there perpetually crop up
sayings which savour of the Gospel rather than of the
Law&mdash;sayings that denote a great advance in thought.
"<i>Study is better than sacrifice</i>," for example, must have
been a very surprising proverb to the backward-looking
Jew. It is only one of many Rabbinical sayings
conceived in the same spirit: but would not the whole
Levitical family listen to it with the wry, clouded face of
grave suspicion? So, when Rabbi Hillel, anticipating
the golden rule, said, "<i>Do not unto another what thou
wouldest not have another do unto thee; this is the whole
law, the rest is mere commentary</i>," the lawyers, with all
who had trusted in ordinances and observances, could
hardly fail to be shocked and alarmed. So, too, when
Rabbi Antigonous said, "<i>Be not as men who serve their
master for the sake of reward, but be like men who serve
not looking for reward</i>;" or when Rabbi Gamaliel said,
"<i>Do God's will as if it were thy will, that He may accomplish
thy will as if it were his</i>," there would be many,
no doubt, who would feel that these venerable rabbis
were bringing in very novel, and possibly very dangerous,
doctrine. Nor could they fail to see what new
fields of thought were being thrown open to them when
Coheleth affirmed the future judgment and the future
life of men. Such "words" as these were in very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
deed "goads," correcting the errors of previous thought,
and urging men on to new pastures of truth and
godliness.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as I have said, the progressive Sage and
the conservative Master would be united in the same
person; for there are those, though there are not too
many of them, who can "stand on the old ways" and
yet "look for the new." But, often, no doubt, the two
would be divided and opposed, then as now. For in
thought, as in politics, there are always two great
parties; the one, looking back with affectionate reverence
and regret on the past, and set to "keep invention in a
<i>noted</i> weed;" the other, looking forward with eager
hope and desire to the future, and attached to "new-found
methods and to compounds strange;" the one,
bent on conserving as much as possible of the large
heritage which our fathers have bequeathed us; the
other, bent on leaving a larger and less encumbered
inheritance to those that shall be after them. The
danger of the conservative thinker is that he may hold
<i>the debts</i> on the estate as part of the estate, that he may
set himself against all liquidations, all better methods
of management, against improvement in every form.
The danger of the progressive thinker is that, in his
generous ambition to improve and enlarge the estate,
he may break violently from the past, and cast away
many heirlooms and hoarded treasures that would add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
largely to our wealth. The one is too apt to pitch his
tents in familiar fields long after they are barren; the
other is too apt to drive men on from old pastures to
new before the old are exhausted or the new ripe.
And, surely, there never was a larger or a more tolerant
heart than that of the Preacher who has taught us that
both these classes of men and teachers, both the conservative
thinker and the progressive thinker, are of
God and have each a useful function to discharge; that
both the shepherd who loves his tent and the herdsman
who wields the goad, both the sage who urges us
forward and the sage who holds us back, are servants
of the one Great Pastor, and owe whether goad or
tent-spike to Him. Simply to entertain the conception
widens and raises our minds; to have conceived it and
thrown it into this perfect form proves the Sacred
Preacher to have been all he claims and more&mdash;not
only Sage, Teacher, Master, Author, but also a true
Poet and a true man of God.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, however, that our accomplished
Sage limits the field of mental activity on either hand
(ver. 12). His children, his disciples&mdash;"my son" was
the rabbi's customary term for his pupils, as "rabbi,"
<i>i.e.</i> "my father," was the title by which the pupil addressed
his master&mdash;are to beware both of the "many
books" of the making of which there was even
then "no end," and of that over-addiction to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
which was a "weariness to the flesh." The latter
caution, the warning against "<i>much</i> study," was a
logical result of that sense of the sanitary value of
physical labour by which, as we have seen, the masters
in Israel were profoundly impressed. They held bodily
exercise to be good for the soul as well as for the body,
a safeguard against the dreamy abstract moods and the
vague fruitless reveries which relax rather than brace
the intellectual fibre, and which tend to a moral languor
all the more perilous because its approaches are masked
under the semblance of mental occupation. They knew
that those who attempt or affect to be "creatures too
bright and good for human nature's daily food" are apt
to sink below the common level rather than to rise
above it. They did not want their disciples to resemble
many of the young men who lounged through the
philosophical schools of Greece and Rome, and who,
though always ready to discuss the "first true, first
perfect, first fair," did nothing to raise the tone of
common life whether by their example or their words;
young men, as Epictetus bitterly remarked of some of
his disciples, whose philosophy lay in their cloaks and
their beards rather than in any wise conduct of their
daily lives or any endeavour to better the world. It
was their aim to develop the whole man&mdash;body, soul,
and spirit; to train up useful citizens as well as
accomplished scholars, to spread the love and pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of wisdom through the whole nation rather than to
produce a separate and learned class. And, in the
prosecution of this aim, they enjoined neither the
exercises of the ancient palæstra, nor athletic sports
like those in vogue at our English seats of learning,
which are often a mere waste of good muscle, but
useful and productive toils. With Ruskin, they believed,
not in "the gospel of the cricket-bat" or of the
gymnasium, but in the gospel of the plough and the
spade, the saw and the axe, the hammer and the
trowel; and saved their disciples from the weariness
of overtaxed brains by requiring them to become
skilled artisans, and to labour heartily in their
vocations.</p>

<p>Nor is the caution against "many books," at which
some critics have taken grave offence, the illiberal
sentiment it has often been pronounced. For, no
doubt, Coheleth, like other wise Hebrews, was fully
prepared to study whatever science would throw light
on the Divine Law, or teach men how to live. Mathematics,
astronomy, natural history, medicine, casuistry,
the ethical and religious systems of the East and the
West,&mdash;some knowledge of all these various branches
of learning was necessary, as has been shown, to
those who had to interpret and administer the statutes
of the Mosaic code, and to supplement them with rules
appropriate to the new conditions of the time. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and kindred studies the rabbis were "masters"; and
what they knew they taught. That which distinguished
them from other men of equal learning was that they
did not "love knowledge for its own sake" merely, but
for its bearing on practice, on conduct. Like Socrates,
they were not content with a purely intellectual culture,
but sought a wisdom that would mingle with the blood
of men and mend their ways, a wisdom that would
hold their baser passions in check, infuse new energy
into the higher moods and aptitudes of the soul, and
make duty their supreme aim and delight. To secure
this great end, they knew no method so likely to prove
effectual as an earnest, or even an exclusive, study of
the Sacred Scriptures in which they thought they had
"eternal life," <i>i.e.</i> the true life of man, the life which
is independent of the chances and changes of time.
Whatever studies would illuminate and illustrate these
Scriptures they pursued and encouraged; whatever
might divert attention from them, they discouraged
and condemned. Many of them, as we learn from the
Talmud, refused to write down the discourses they delivered
in School or Synagogue lest, by making books
of their own, they should withdraw attention from the
Inspired Writings. It was better they thought to read
the Scriptures than any commentary on the Scriptures,
and hence they confined themselves to oral instruction:
even their profoundest and most characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
sayings would have perished if "fond tradition" had
not "babbled" of them for many an age to come.</p>

<p>If the sentiment which dictated this course was in
part a mistaken sentiment, it sprang from a noble
motive. For no ordinance could be more self-denying
to a learned and literary class than one which forbade
them to put on record the results of their researches,
the conclusions of their wisdom, and thus to win name
and fame and use in after generations. But was their
course, after all, one which calls for censure? Has
the world ever produced a literature so noble, so pure,
so lofty and heroic in its animating spirit, as that of
the Hebrew historians and poets? "The world is
forwarded by having its attention fixed on the best
things," says Matthew Arnold in his Preface to his
selection of Wordsworth's poems, and proceeds to
define the best things as those works of the great
masters of song which have won the approval "of the
whole group of civilised nations." But even those
whom the civilised world has acclaimed as its highest
and best have confessed that in the Bible, viewed
simply as literature, their noblest work is far excelled:
and what sane man will deny that "Faust," for example,
would cut a sorry figure if compared with "Job," which
our own greatest living poet has pronounced "the finest
poem whether of ancient or of modern times," or Wordsworth
himself if placed side by side with Isaiah? Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
can doubt, then, that the world would have been "forwarded"
if its attention had been fixed on this "best"?
Who can doubt that it would be infinitely sweeter and
better than it is if these ancient Scriptures had been
studied before and above all other writings, if they had
been brooded over and wrought into the minds of men
till "the life" in them had been assimilated and reproduced?
The man who has had a classical or scientific
education, and profited by it, must be an ingrate indeed,
unless he be the slave of some dominant crotchet, if he
do not hold in grateful reverence the great masters at
whose feet he has sat; but the man who has really
found "life" in the Scriptures must be worse than an
ingrate if he does not feel that a merely mental culture
is a small good when compared with the treasures of
an eternal life, if he does not admit that the main
object of all education should be to conduct men
through a course of intellectual training which shall
culminate in a moral and spiritual discipline. To be
wise is much; but how much more is it to be good!
Better be a child <i>in</i> the kingdom of heaven than a
philosopher or a poet hanging vaguely about its
outskirts.</p>

<p>If any of us still suspect the Preacher's words of
illiberality, and say, "There was no need to oppose the
one Book to the many, and to depreciate these in order
to magnify that," we have only to consider the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
circumstances in which he wrote in order to acquit him
of the charge. For generations the Holy Scriptures
had been neglected by the Jews; copies had grown
scarce, and were hidden away in obscure nooks in which
they were hard to find; some of the inspired writings
had been lost, and have not been recovered to this day.
The people were ignorant of their own history, and
law, and hope. Suddenly they were awaked from the
slumber of indifference, to find themselves in a night
of ignorance. During the miseries of the Captivity a
longing for the Divine Word was quickened within
them. They were eager to acquaint themselves with
the Revelation which they had neglected and forgotten.
And their teachers, the few men who knew and loved
the Word, set themselves to deepen and to satisfy the
craving. They multiplied copies of the Scriptures, circulated
them, explained them in the Schools, exhorted
from them in the Synagogues. And, till the people
were familiar with the Scriptures, the wiser rabbis
would not write books of their own, and looked with a
jealous eye on the "many books" bred by the literary
activity of the time. It was the very feeling which
preceded and accompanied the English Reformation.
<i>Then</i> the newly-discovered Bible threw all other books
into the shade. The people thirsted for the pure Word
of God; and the leaders of the Reformation were very
well content that they should read nothing else till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
had read <i>that</i>; that they should leave all other fountains
to drink of "the river of life." The translation and
circulation of the Scriptures was the one work, almost
the exclusive work, to which they bent their energies.
Like the Jewish rabbis, Tyndale and his fellow-labourers
did not care to write books themselves, nor wish the
people to read the books they were compelled to write
in self-defence. There is a remarkable passage in
Fryth's <i>Scripture Doctrine of the Sacrament</i>, in which,
replying to Sir Thomas More, the Reformer says:
"This hath been offered you, is offered, and shall be
offered. Grant that the Word of God, I mean the
text of Scripture, may go abroad in our English
tongue ... and my brother Tyndale and I have done,
and will promise you to write no more. If you will
not grant this condition, then will we be doing while
we have breath, and show in few words that the
Scripture doth in many, and so at the least save some."
The Hebrew Reformers of the school of Coheleth were
animated by precisely the same lofty and generous
spirit. They were content to be nothing, that the
Word of God might be all in all. "The Bible, and
the Bible only," they conceived to be the want of their
age and race; and hence they were content to forego
the honours of authorship, and the study of many
branches of learning which under other conditions they
would have been glad to pursue, and besought their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
disciples to concentrate all their thoughts on the one
Book which was able to make them wise unto salvation.
Learned themselves, and often profoundly
learned, it was no contempt for learning which actuated
them, but a devout godliness and the fervours of a
most self-denying piety.</p>

<p>So far the Epilogue may seem a mere digression, not
without interest and value indeed, but having no vital
connection with the main theme of the Poem. It tells
us that the Preacher was a sage, a recognised official
teacher, the master of an assembly, a doctor of laws,
an author who had expended much labour on many
proverbs, a conservative shepherd pitching his tent
on familiar fields of thought, a progressive herdsman
goading men on to new pastures&mdash;<i>not</i> Solomon therefore,
by the way, for who would have described <i>him</i>
in such terms as these? If we are glad to know so
much of him, we cannot but ask, What has all this to
do with the quest of the Chief Good? It has this to
do with it. Coheleth has achieved the quest; he has
solved his problem, and has given us his solution
of it. He is about to repeat that solution. To give
emphasis and force to the repetition, that he may carry
his readers more fully with him, he dwells on his
claims to their respect, their confidence, their affection.
He is all that they most admire; he carries the very
authority to which they most willingly defer. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
know this&mdash;and, scattered as they were through many
cities and provinces, how should they know it unless
he told them?&mdash;they cannot refuse him a hearing; they
will be predisposed to accept his conclusion; they will
be sure not to reject it without consideration. It is
out of any personal conceit, therefore, nor any
pride of learning, nor even that he may grant himself
the relief of lifting his mask from his face for a moment,
that he recounts his titles to their regard. He is simply
gathering force from the willing respect and deference
of his readers in order that he may plant his final
conclusion more strongly and more deeply in their
hearts.</p>

<p>And what is the conclusion which he is at such
pains to enforce? "<i>The conclusion of the matter is
this; that God taketh cognizance of all things: fear Him,
therefore, and keep his commandments, for this it behoveth
every man to do; since God will bring every deed
to the judgment appointed for every secret thing, whether
it be good or whether it be bad</i>" (vv. 13, 14).</p>

<p>Now that this "conclusion" is simply a repetition, in
part expanded and in part condensed, of that with which
the Preacher closes the previous Section, is obvious.
<i>There</i> he incites men to a life of virtue with two leading
motives: first, by the fact of the present constant
judgment of God; and, secondly, by the prospect of a
future, a more searching and decisive, judgment. <i>Here</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
he appeals to precisely the same motives, though now,
instead of implying a present judgment under the injunction
"Remember thy Creator," he broadly affirms
that "God takes note of all things;" and, instead of
simply reminding the young that God will bring "the
ways of their heart" into judgment, he defines that
future judgment at once more largely and more exactly
as "appointed for every secret thing" and extending
to "every deed," both good and bad. In dealing with
the motives of a virtuous life, therefore, he goes a little
beyond his former lines of thought, gives them a wider
scope, makes them more sharp and definite. On the
other hand, in speaking of the forms which the virtuous
or ideal life assumes, he is very curt and brief. All
he has to say on that point now is, "Fear God and
keep his commandments;" whereas, in his previous
treatment of it, he had much to say, bidding us for
instance, "cast our bread upon the waters," and "give
a portion to seven, and even to eight;" bidding us
"sow our seed morning and evening," though "the
clouds" should be "full of rain," and whatever "the
course of the wind;" bidding us "rejoice" in all our
labours, and carry to all our self-denials the merry
heart that physics pain. As we studied the meaning
of the beautiful metaphors of chapter xi., sought to
gather up their several meanings into an orderly connection,
and to express them in a more literal logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
form&mdash;to translate them, in short, from the Eastern to
the Western mode&mdash;we found that the main virtues
enjoined by the Preacher were charity, industry, cheerfulness;
the charity which does good hoping for nothing
again, the industry which bends itself to the present
duty in scorn of omen or consequence; and the cheerfulness
which springs from a consciousness of the
Divine presence, from the conviction that, however
men may misjudge us, God knows us altogether and
will do us justice. This was our summary of the
Preacher's argument, of his solution of the supreme
moral problem of human life. Here, in the Epilogue,
he gives us his own summary in the words, "Fear
God, and keep his commandments."</p>

<p>If we compare these two summaries, there seems at
first rather difference than resemblance between them:
the one appears, if more indefinite, much more comprehensive,
than the other. Yet there is one point of
resemblance which soon strikes us. For we know by
this time that on the Preacher's lips "Fear God" does
not mean "Be afraid of God;" that it indicates and
demands just that reverent sense of the Divine Presence,
that strong inward conviction of the constant judgment
He passes on all our ways and motives and thoughts,
which Coheleth has already affirmed to be a prime
safeguard of virtue. It is the phrase "and keep his
commandments" that sounds so much larger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
anything we have heard from him before, so much more
comprehensive. For the commandments of God are
many and very broad. He reveals his will in the
natural universe and the laws which govern it; laws
which, as we are part of the universe, we need to know
and to obey. He reveals his will in the social and
political forces which govern the history and development
of the various races of mankind, which therefore
meet and affect us at every turn. He reveals his will
in the ethical intuitions and codes which govern the
formation of character, which enter into and give shape
to all in us that is most spiritual, profound, and enduring.
To keep all the commandments revealed in these
immense fields of Divine activity with an intelligent
and invariable obedience is simply impossible to us; it
is the perfection which flows round our imperfection,
and towards which it is our one great task to be ever
reaching forth. Is it as inciting us to this impossible
perfection that the Preacher bids us "fear God and
keep his commandments"?</p>

<p>Yes and No. It is not as having this large perfect
ideal distinctly before his mind that he utters the
injunction, although in the course of this Book he has
glanced at every element of it; nor even as having so
much of it in his mind as is expressed in the law that
came by Moses, although that too includes precepts for
the physical and the political as well as for the moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and religious provinces of human life. What he meant
by bidding us "keep the commandments" was, I
apprehend, that we should take the counsels he has
already given us, and follow after charity, industry,
cheerfulness. Every other phrase in this final "conclusion"
is, as we have seen, a repetition of the truths
announced at the close of the previous Section, and
therefore we may fairly assume this phrase to contain
a truth&mdash;the truth of Duty&mdash;which he there illustrates.
Throughout the whole Book there is not a single
technical allusion, no allusion to the Temple, to the
feasts, to the sacrifices, rites, ceremonies of the Law;
and therefore we can hardly take this reference to the
"commandments" as an allusion to the Mosaic table.
By the rules of fair interpretation we are bound to
take these commandments as previously defined by the
Preacher himself, to understand him as once more
enforcing the virtues which, for him, comprised the
whole duty of man.</p>

<p>Do we thus limit and degrade the moral ideal, or
represent him as degrading and limiting it? By no
means: for to love our neighbour, to discharge the
present duty whatever rain may fall and whatever
storm may blow, to carry a bright hopeful spirit
through all our toils and charities; to do this in the
fear of God, as in his Presence, because He is judging
and will judge us&mdash;this, surely, includes all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
essential even in the loftiest ideal of moral duty and
perfection. For how are we to be cheerful and dutiful
and kind except as we obey the commandments of
God in whatever form they may have been revealed?
The diseases which result from a violation of sanitary
laws, as also the ignorance or the wilfulness or the
impotence which lead us to violate social or ethical
laws, of necessity and by natural consequence impair
our cheerfulness, our strength for laborious duties,
our neighbourly serviceableness and good-will. To
live the life which the Preacher enjoins, on the inspiration
of the motives which he supplies, is therefore, in
the largest and broadest sense, to keep the commandments
of God.</p>

<p>What advantage, then, is there in saying, "Be kind,
be dutiful, be cheerful," over saying, "Obey the laws of
God"? There is this great practical advantage that,
while in the last resort the one rule of life is as comprehensive
as the other, and just as difficult, it is more
definite, more portable, and does not sound so difficult.
It is the very advantage which our Lord's memorable
summary, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself," has over the
Law and the Prophets. Bid a man keep the whole
Mosaic code as interpreted by the prophets of a thousand
years, and you set him a task so heavy, so hopeless,
that he may well decline it; only to understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
bearing and harmony of the Mosaic statutes, and to
gather the sense in which the prophets&mdash;to say nothing
of the rabbis&mdash;interpreted them, is the labour of a lifetime,
a labour for which even the whole life of a trained
scholar is insufficient. But bid him "love God and
man," and you give him a principle which his own
conscience at once accepts and confirms, a golden rule
or principle which if he be of a good heart and a
willing mind, he will be able to apply to the details and
problems of life as they arise. In like manner if you
say: "The true ideal of life is to be reached only by
the man who comprehends and obeys all the laws of
God revealed in the physical universe, in the history of
humanity, in the moral intuitions and discoveries of the
race," you set men a task so stupendous as that no
man ever has or will be able to accomplish it. Say, on
the other hand, "Do the duty of every hour as it passes,
without fretting about future issues; help your neighbour
to do his duty or to bear his burden, even though
he may never have helped you; be blithe and cheerful
even when your work is hard and your neighbour is
ungrateful or unkind," and you speak straight to a
man's heart, to his sense of what is right and good;
you summon every noble and generous instinct of his
nature to his aid. He can begin to practise this rule
of life without preliminary and exhausting study of its
meaning; and if he finds it <i>work</i>, as assuredly he will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he will be encouraged to make it <i>his</i> rule. He will
soon discover, indeed, that it means more than he
thought, that it is not so easy to apply to the complexities
of human affairs, that it is very much harder
to keep than he supposed: but its depth and difficulty
will open on him gradually, as he is able to bear them.
If his heart now and then faint, if hand and foot falter,
still God is with him, with him to help and reward as
well as to judge; and <i>that</i> conviction once in his
mind is there for ever, a constant spur to thought, to
obedience, to patience.</p>

<p>In nothing, indeed, does the wisdom of the Hebrew
sages show its superiority over that of the other sages
of antiquity more decisively than in its adaptation to
the practical needs of men busied in the common affairs
of life, and with no learning and no leisure for the
study of large intricate problems. It comes straight
down into the beaten ways of men. If you read Confucius,
for example, and still more if you read Plato, you
cannot fail to be struck with their immense grasp of
thought, or their profound learning, or even their moral
enthusiasm; as you read, you will often meet with wise
rules of life expressed in beautiful forms. And yet your
main feeling will be that they give you, and men like you,
if at least you be of the common build, as most of us
are, little help; that unless you had their rare endowments,
or could give yourself largely and long to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
study of their works, you could hardly hope to learn
what they have to teach, or order your life by their
plan. And that this feeling is just is proved by the
histories of China and Greece, different as they are.
In China only students, only literati, are so much as
supposed to understand the Confucian system of thought
and ethics; the great bulk of the people have to be
content with a few rules and forms and rites which are
imposed on them by authority. In ancient Greece, the
wisdom to which her great masters attained was only
taught in the Schools to men addicted to philosophical
studies; even the natural and moral truths on which
the popular mythology was based were hidden in
"mysteries" open only to the initiated few; while the
great mass of the people were amused with fables
which they misapprehended, and with rites which they
soon degraded into licentious orgies. No man cared
for <i>their</i> souls; their errors were not corrected, their
license was not rebuked. Their wise men made no
effort to lift them to a height from which they might
see that the whole of morality lay in the love of God
and man, in charity, diligent devotion to duty, cheerfulness.
But it was far otherwise with the Hebrews
and their sages. Men such as the Preacher confined
themselves to no school or class, but carried their
wisdom to the synagogue, to the market-place, to the
popular assemblies. They invented no "mysteries,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
but brought down the mysteries of Heaven to the
understanding of the simple. Instead of engaging in
lofty abstract speculations in which only the learned
could follow them, they compressed the loftiest wisdom
into plain moral rules which the unlettered could
apprehend, and urged them to obedience by motives and
promises which went home to the popular heart. And
they had their reward. The truths they taught became
familiar to all sorts and conditions of Hebrew men;
they became a factor, and the most influential factor,
in the national life. Fishermen, carpenters, tent-makers,
sandal-makers, shepherds, husbandmen, grew
studious of the Divine Will and learned the secrets of
righteousness and peace. During the wonderful revival
of literary and religious activity which followed the
exile in Babylon&mdash;a revival mainly owing to these Sages&mdash;every
child was compelled to attend a common
school in which the sacred Scriptures were taught by
the ablest and most learned rabbis; in which, as we
learn from the Talmud, the duty of leading a religious
life in all outward conditions, even to the poorest, was
impressed upon them, and the virtues of charity,
industry, and cheerfulness were enforced as the very
soul of religion. Here, for example, is a legend from
the Talmud, and it is only one of many, which illustrates
and confirms all that has just been said.&mdash;"A
sage, while walking in a crowded market-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
suddenly encountered the prophet Elijah, and asked
him who, out of that vast multitude, would be saved.
Whereupon the Prophet first pointed out a weird-looking
creature, a turnkey, 'because he was merciful
to his prisoners,' and next two common-looking
tradesmen who were walking through the crowd,
pleasantly chatting together. The sage instantly
rushed after them, and asked them what were their
saving works. But they, much puzzled, replied: 'We
are but poor working-men who live by our trade. All
that can be said for us is that we are always cheerful
and good-natured. When we meet anybody who seems
sad, we join him, and we talk to him and cheer him up,
that he may forget his grief. And if we know of two
people who have quarrelled, we talk to them, and
persuade them till we have made them friends again.
This is our whole life.'" It is impossible that such
a legend should have sprung up on any but Hebrew
soil. Had Confucius been asked to point out the man
whom Heaven most approved, he would probably have
replied, "The superior man is catholic, not sectarian;
he is observant of the rules of propriety and decorum;
and he does not do to others what he would not have
done to himself:"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and he would certainly have looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
for him in some state official distinguished by his wise
administration. Had any of the Greek sages been
asked the same question, they would have found their
perfect man in the philosopher who, raised above the
common passions and aims of men, gave himself to the
pursuit of an abstract and speculative wisdom. Only
a Hebrew would have looked for him in that low estate
in which the one truly Perfect Man dwelt among us.
And yet how that Hebrew legend charms and touches
and satisfies us! What a hope for humanity there is
in the thought that the poor weird-looking jailer who
was merciful to his prisoners, and the kindly, industrious,
cheerful working-men, living by their craft, and
incapable of regarding their diligence and good-nature
as "saving works," stood higher than priest or rabbi,
ruler or philosopher! How welcome and ennobling is
the conviction that there are last who yet are first&mdash;last
with men, first with God; that turnkeys and
artisans, publicans and sinners even, may draw nearer
to Heaven than sophist or flamen, sage or prince!
Who so poor but that he has a little "bread" to cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
on the thankless unreturning waters? who so faint of
heart but that he may sow a little "seed" even when
the winds rave and the sky is full of clouds? who so
solitary and forlorn but that he may say a word of
comfort to a weeping neighbour, or seek to make "two
people who have quarrelled friends again"? And this
is all that the Preacher, all that God through the Preacher,
asks of us.</p>

<p><i>All</i>&mdash;yet even this is much; even for this we shall
need the pressure of constant and weighty motives:
for it is not only occasional acts which are required of
us, but settled tempers and habits of goodwill, industry,
and cheerfulness; and to love all men, to rejoice
alway, to do our duty in all weathers and all moods,
is very hard work to our feeble, selfish, and easily-dejected
natures. Does the Preacher supply us with
such motives as we need? He offers us two motives;
one in the present judgment, another in the future
judgment of God. "God is with you," he says, "taking
cognizance of all you do; and you will soon be with
God, to give Him an account of every secret and every
deed." But that is an appeal to fear&mdash;is it not? It is,
rather, an appeal to love and hope. He has no thought
of frightening us into obedience&mdash;for the obedience of
fear is not worth having, is <i>not</i> obedience in the true
sense; but he <i>is</i> trying to win and allure us to obedience.
For whatever terrors God's judgment or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
future world may have for us, it is very certain that
these terrors were in large measure unknown to the
Jews. The Talmud knows nothing of "hell," nothing
of an everlasting torture. Even the "Sheol" of the
Old Testament is simply the "under-world" in which
the Jews believed the spirits of both good men and bad
to be gathered after death. And, to the Jews for whom
Coheleth wrote, the judgment of God, whether here or
hereafter, would have singular and powerful attractions.
They were in captivity to merciless and capricious
despots who took no pains to understand their character
or to deal with them according to their works,
who had no sense of justice, no kindness, no ruth for
slaves. For men thus oppressed and hopeless there
would be an infinite comfort in the thought that God,
the Great Ruler and Disposer, knew them altogether,
saw all their struggles to maintain his worship and
to acquaint themselves with his will, took note of every
wrong they suffered, "was afflicted in all their afflictions,"
and would one day call both them and their
oppressors to the bar at which all wrongs are at once
righted and avenged. Would it affright <i>them</i> to hear
that "God taketh cognizance of all things," and has
"appointed a judgment for every secret and every
deed"? Would not this be, rather, their strongest
consolation, their brightest hope? Would they not do
their duty with better heart if they knew that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
saw how hard it was to do? Would they not show
a more constant kindness to their neighbours, if they
knew that God would openly reward every alms done
in secret? Would they not carry a blither and more
patient spirit to all their labours and afflictions if they
knew that a day of recompenses was at hand? The
Preacher thought they would; and hence he bids them
"rejoice," bids them "banish care and sadness," <i>because</i>
God will bring them into judgment, and incites them
to "keep the commandments" <i>because</i> God's eye is
upon them, and because, in the judgment, He will not
forget the work of their obedience, the labour of their
love.</p>

<p>This, to some of us, may be a novel view whether
of the present or of the future judgment of God. For
the most part, I fear, we speak of the Divine judgments
as terrible and well-nigh unendurable. We would
escape them even here, if we could; but, above all, we
dread them when we shall stand before the bar at
which the secrets of all hearts will be disclosed. Now
we need not, and we must not, lose ought of the awe
and reverence for Him who is our God and Father
which, so far from impairing, deepens our love. But
we need to remember that fear is base, that it is the
enemy of love; that so long as we anticipate the
Divine judgments only or mainly with dread, we are
far from the love which gives value and charm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
obedience; and that, if we are to be good and at peace,
we must "shut out fear with all the strength of hope."
What is it that we fear? Suffering! But why should
we fear that, if it will make us perfect? Death! But
why should we fear that, if it will take us home to our
Father? God's anger! But God is not angry with
us if we love Him and try to do his will; He loves us
even when we sin against Him, and shows his love in
making the way of sin so hard to us that we are constrained
to leave it. Ought we, then, to dread, ought
we not rather to desire, the judgments by which we are
corrected, purified, saved?</p>

<p>"But the future judgment&mdash;that is so dreadful!"
<i>Is</i> it? God knows us as we are already: is it so very
much worse that we should know ourselves, and that
our neighbours should know us? If among our
"secrets" there be many things evil, are there not at
least some that are good? Do we not find ourselves
perpetually thwarted or hindered in our endeavours to
give form and scope to our purest emotions, our
tenderest sympathies, our loftiest resolves? Do we not
perpetually complain that, when we would do good,
even if evil is not present to overcome the good, it is
present to mar it, to make our goodness poor, scanty,
ungraceful? Well, these obstructed purposes and intentions
and resolves, all the good in us that has been
frustrated or deformed, or limited, by our social conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
by our lack of power, culture, expression, by
the clogging flesh or the flagging brain,&mdash;all these are
among "the secret things" which God will bring to
light; and we may be sure that He will not think less
of these, his own work in us, than of the manifold sins
by which we have marred his work. We are in some
danger of regarding "the judgment" as a revelation of
our trespasses only, instead of every deed, and every
secret, whether good or bad. Once conceive of it
aright, as the revelation of the whole man, as the
unveiling of <i>all</i> that is in us, and mere honesty might
lead us to desire rather than to dread it. One of the
finest and most devout spirits of modern France<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
has said: "It seems to me intolerable to appear to
men other than we appear to God. My worst torture
at this moment is the over-estimate which generous
friends form of me. We are told that at the last judgment
the secret of all consciences will be laid bare
to the universe: <i>would that mine were so this day,
and that every passer-by could read me as I am!</i>" To
seem what we are, to be known for what we are,
to be treated as we are, this is the judgment of God.
And, though this judgment must bring even the best
of us much shame and much sorrow, who that sincerely
loves God and truth will not rejoice to have
done at last with all masks and veils, to wear his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
natural colours, and to take his true place, even though
it be the lowest?</p>

<p>To have got out of "the corrupted currents" of which
audacious and strong injustice so often avails itself to
our hurt; to be quit of all the shuffling equivocations
by which we often pervert the true character of our
actions, and persuade ourselves that we are other and
better than we are; to be compelled to look our faults
straight and fairly in the face; to have all the latent
goodness of our natures developed, and their fettered
and obstructed virtue liberated from every bond; to
see our every "secret" good as well as bad, and our
every "deed" good as well as bad, exposed in their
true colours: is there no hope, no comfort for us, in
such a prospect as this? It is a prospect full of comfort,
full of hope, if at least we have any real trust in
the grace and goodness of God; and if, through his
grace, we have set ourselves to do our duty, to love
our neighbour, and to bear the changes and burdens
of life with a patient cheerful heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Now that we have once more heard the Preacher's
final conclusion, we shall have no difficulty in fitting
into its place, or valuing at its worth, the partial and
provisional conclusion to which he rises at the close of
the previous Sections of the Book. In the First Section
he describes his quest of the Chief Good in Wisdom
and in Mirth; he declares that, though both wisdom
and mirth are good, neither of them is the supreme
good of life, nor both combined; and, in despair of
reaching any higher mark, he closes with the admission
(ch. ii., vv. 24-26) that even for the man who is both
wise and good "there is nothing better than to eat and
to drink, and to let his soul take pleasure in all his
labour." In the Second Section he pursues his quest
in Devotion to Business and to Public Affairs, only to
find his former conclusion confirmed (ch. v., vv. 18-20):
"Behold, that which I have said holds good; it <i>is</i> well
for a man to eat and to drink, and to enjoy all the good
of his labour through the brief day of his life; this is
his portion; and he should take his portion and rejoice
in his labour, remembering that the days of his life are
not many, and that God meant him to work for the
enjoyment of his heart." In the Third Section, his
quest in Wealth and in the Golden Mean conducts him
by another road to the same bright resting-place which,
however, for all so bright as it looks, he seems to enter
every time with a more rueful and dejected gait (ch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
viii., ver. 15): more and more sadly he "commends
mirth, because there is nothing better for man than to
eat and to drink and to rejoice, and because <i>this</i> will
go with him to his work through the days of his life
which God giveth him under the sun." To my mind
there is a strange pathos in the mournful tones in
which the Preacher commends mirth, in the plaintive
minors of a voice from which we should naturally expect
the clear ringing majors of joy. As we listen to
these recurring notes, we feel that he has been baffled
in his Quest; that, starting every day in a fresh direction
and travelling till he is weary and spent, he finds
himself night after night at the very spot he had left
in the morning, and can only alleviate the unwelcome
surprise of finding himself no farther and no higher
by muttering, "As well here perhaps as elsewhere!"
No votary of mirth and jollity surely ever wore so
woebegone a countenance, or sang their praises with
more trembling and uncertain lips. What can be more
hopeless than his "<i>there is nothing better</i>, so you must
even be content with this," or than the way in which
he harps on the brevity of life! You feel that the
man has been passionately seeking for something better,
for a good which would be a good not only through
the brief hours of time but for ever; that it is with a
heart saddened by the sense of wasted endeavour and
cravings unsatisfied that he falls back on pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
as brief as his day, as wearisome as his toils. Yet
all the while he feels, and makes you feel, that
there is a certain measure of truth in his conclusion;
that mirth is a great good, though not the greatest;
that if he could but find that "something better"
of which he is in quest, he would learn the secret
of a deeper mirth than that which springs from
eating and drinking and sensuous delights, a mirth
which would not set with the setting sun of his
brief day.</p>

<p>This feeling is justified by the issue. Now that the
Preacher has completed his circle of thought, we can
see that it <i>is</i> well for a man to rejoice and take pleasure
in his labours, that God did mean him to work for the
enjoyment of his heart, that there is a mirth purer and
more enduring than that which springs from knowledge,
or from the gratification of the senses, or from
success in affairs, or from the possession of much
goods,&mdash;a mirth for this life which expands and deepens
into an everlasting joy. Throughout his Quest he
has held fast to the conviction that "it is a comely
fashion to be glad," though he could allege no
better reason for his conviction than the transitoriness
of life and the impossibility of reaching any higher
good. Before he could justify this conviction, he must
achieve his Quest. It is only when he has learned to
regard our life&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i10">"as a harp,</span>
<span class="i0">A gracious instrument on whose fair strings</span>
<span class="i0">We learn those airs we shall be set to play</span>
<span class="i0">When mortal hours are ended,"</span>
</div>

<p>that his plaintive minors pass into the frank, jocund
tones appropriate to a sincere and well-grounded
mirth. <i>Now</i> he can cease to "trouble heaven with his
bootless cries" on the indiscrimination of death and the
vanity of life. He can now say to his soul,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"What hast thou to do with sorrow</span>
<span class="i0">Or the injuries of to-morrow?"</span>
</div>

<p>for he has discovered that no morrow can any more
injure him, no sorrow rob him of his true joy. God is
with him, observing all the postures and moods of his
soul, and adapting all his circumstances to the correction
of what is evil in him or the cultivation of what is
good. There is no dark impassable gulf between this
world and the next; life does not cease at death, but
grows more intense and full; death is but a second
birth into a second and better life, a life of ampler and
happier conditions, and yet a life which is the continuation
and consummation of that we now live in the
flesh. All that he has to do, therefore, is to "fear
God and keep his commandments," leaving the issues
of his labour in the Hands which bend all things to a
final goal of good. What though the clouds drop rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
or the winds blew bitterly, what though his diligence
a charity meet no present recognition or reward?
All that is no business of his. He has only to do the
duty of the passing hour, and to help his neighbours
do their duty. So long as he can do this, why should
he not be bright and gay? In this lies his Chief
Good: why should he not enjoy <i>that</i>, even though other
and lesser goods be taken from him for a time&mdash;be
lent to the Lord that they may hereafter be repaid with
usury? He is no longer "a pipe for fortune's finger
to sound what stop she please:" he has a tune of his
own, "a cheerful tune," to play, and <i>will</i> play it, let
fortune be in what mood she please. He is not
"passion's slave," but the servant and friend of God;
and because God is with him and for him, and because
he will soon be with God, he is</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,"</span>
</div>

<p>and can take "fortune's buffets and rewards with equal
thanks." His cheerful content does not lie at the mercy
of accident; the winds and waves of vicissitude cannot
prevail against it: for it has two broad and solid
foundations; one on earth, and the other in heaven.
On the one hand, it springs from a faithful discharge of
personal duty and the neighbourly charity which hopeth
all things and endureth all things; on the other hand,
it springs from the conviction that God takes note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
all things, and will bring every secret and every deed
into a judgment perfectly just and perfectly kind. The
fair structure which rises on these sure foundations
is not to be shaken by ought that does not sap the
foundations on which it rests. Convince him that God
is not with him, or that God does not so care for him
as to judge and correct him; or convict him of gross
and constant failures in duty and in charity; and then,
indeed, you touch, you endanger, his peace. But no
external loss, no breath of change, no cloud in the
sky of his fortunes, no loss, no infirmity that does not
impede him in the discharge of duty, can do more than
cast a passing shadow on his heart. Whatever happens,
into whatever new conditions or new worlds he may
pass, his chief good and therefore his supreme joy is
with him.</p>

<p>Now, too, without fear or favour, without any prejudice
for or against his conclusion because we find it
in Holy Writ, we may ask ourselves, Has the Preacher
satisfactorily solved the problem which he took in hand?
has he really achieved his Quest and attained the Chief
Good? One thing is quite clear; he has not lost
himself in speculations foreign to our experience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
remote from it; he has dealt with the common facts of
life such as they were in his time, such as they remain
in ours: for now, as then, men are restless and craving,
and seek the satisfactions of rest in science or in
pleasure, in successful public careers or in the fortunate
conduct of affairs, by securing wealth or by laying up a
modest provision for present and future wants. Now,
as then,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The common problem, yours, mine, everyone's,</span>
<span class="i0">Is not to fancy what were fair in life</span>
<span class="i0">Providing it could be,&mdash;but, finding first</span>
<span class="i0">What may be, then find how to make it fair</span>
<span class="i0">Up to our means&mdash;a very different thing."</span>
</div>

<p>That the Preacher should have attacked this common
problem, and should have handled it with the practical
good sense which characterises his Poem, is a point,
and a large point, in his favour.</p>

<p>Nor is the conclusion at which he arrives, in its
substance, peculiar to him, or even to the Scriptures.
He says: The perfect man, the ideal man, is he who
addresses himself to the present duty untroubled by
adverse clouds and currents, who so loves his neighbour
that he can do good even to the evil and the unthankful,
and who carries a brave cheerful temper to the
unrewarded toils and sacrifices of his life, because God
is with him, taking note of all he does, and because
there is a future life for which this course of duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
charity, and magnanimity, is the best preparative. He
affirms that the man who has risen to the discovery
and practice of this ideal has attained the Chief Good,
that he has found a duty from which no accident can
divert him, a pure and tranquil joy which will sustain
him under all change and loss. And, on his
behalf, I am bold to assert that, allowing for inevitable
differences of conception and utterance, his conclusion
is the conclusion of all the great teachers of morality.
Take any of the ancient systems of morality and
religion&mdash;Hindu, Egyptian, Persian, Chinese, Greek,
or Latin; select those elements of it in virtue of which
it has lived and ruled over myriads of men; reduce
those elements to their simplest forms, express them in
the plainest words; and, as I believe, you will find
that in every case they are only different and modified
versions of the final conclusion of the Preacher. "Do
your duty patiently; Be kind and helpful one to
another; Shew a cheerful content with your lot;
Heaven is with you and will judge you:"&mdash;these brief
maxims seem to be the ethical epitome of all the creeds
and systems that have had their day, as also of those
which have not ceased to be. It is very true that the
motive to obedience which Coheleth draws from the
future life of man has been of a varying force and
influence, rising perhaps to its greatest clearness among
the Egyptians and the Persians, sinking to its dimmest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
among the Greeks and the Romans, although we cannot
say it did not shine even upon these; for, though
the secret of their "mysteries" has been kept with
a rare fidelity, yet the general impression of Antiquity
concerning them was that, besides disclosing to the
initiated the natural and moral truths on which the
popular mythology was based, they "opened to man
a comforting prospect of a future state." I am not
careful to show how the Word of Inspiration surpasses
all other "scriptures" in the precision with which it
enunciates the elementary truths of all morality, in its
freedom from admixture with baser matter, in its application
of those truths to all sorts and conditions of
men, and the power of the motives by which it enforces
them. That is no part of my present duty. The one
point to which I ask attention is this: With what
an enormous weight of authority, drawn from all creeds
and systems, from the whole ethical experience of
humanity, the conclusion of the Preacher is clothed;
how we stand rebuked by the wisdom of all past ages
if, after duly testing it, we have not adopted his solution
of the master-problem of life, and are not working
it out. Out of every land, in all the different languages
of the divided earth, from the lips of all the ancient sages
whom we reverence for their excellence or for their
wisdom, no less than from the mouths of prophet and
psalmist, preacher and apostle, there come to us voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
which with one consent bid us "fear God and keep
his commandments;"&mdash;a sacred chorus which paces
down the long-drawn aisles of Time, chanting the
praise of the man who does his duty even though he
lose by it, who loves his neighbour even though he
win no love in return, who breasts the blows of circumstance
with a tranquil heart, who by a wise use
and a wise enjoyment of the life that now is qualifies
himself for the better life to be.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This, then, is the Hebrew solution of "the common
problem." It is also the Christian solution. For when
"the Fellow of the Lord of hosts," instead of "clutching
at his equality with God," humbled Himself and took
on Him the form of a servant, the very ideal of perfect
manhood became incarnate in this "man from heaven."
Does the Hebrew Preacher, backed by the consentient
voices of the great sages of Antiquity, demand that the
ideal man, moved thereto by his sense of a constant
Divine Presence and the hope of God's future judgment,
should cast the bread of his charity on the thankless
waters of neighbourly ingratitude, give himself with all
diligence to the discharge of duty whatever clouds may
darken his sky, whatever unkindly wind may nip his
harvest, and maintain a calm and cheerful temper in
all weathers, and through all the changing scenes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
seasons of life? His demand is met, and surpassed,
by the Man Christ Jesus. <i>He</i> loved all men with
a love which the many waters of their hostility and
unthankfulness could not quench. Always about his
Father's business, when He laid aside the glory He
had with the Father before the world was, He put off
the robes of a king to don the weeds of the husbandman,
and went forth to sow in all weathers, beside all
waters, undaunted by any wind of opposition or any
threatening cloud. In all the shock of hostile circumstance,
in the abiding agony and passion of a life
"short in years indeed, but in sorrows above all
measure long," He carried Himself with a cheerful
patience and serenity which never wavered, for the joy
set before Him enduring, and even despising, the bitter
cross. In fine, the very virtues inculcated by the
Preacher were the very substance of "the highest,
holiest manhood." And if we ask, What were the
motives which inspired this life of consummate and
unparalleled excellence? we find among them the very
motives suggested by Coheleth. The strong Son of
Man and of God was never alone, because the Father
was with Him, as truly with Him while He was on
earth as when He was in the heaven from which He
"came down." He never bated heart nor hope because
He knew that He would soon be with God once more,
to be judged of Him and recompensed according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
deeds done in the body of his humiliation. Men might
misjudge Him, but the Judge of all the earth would
do Him right. Men might award Him only a crown
of thorns; but God would touch the thorns and, at
his quickening touch, they would flower into a garland
of immortal beauty and honour.</p>

<p>Nor did the Lord Jesus help us in our quest of the
Chief Good only by becoming a Pattern of all virtue
and excellence. The work of his Redemption is a
still more sovereign help. By the sacrifice of the
Cross He took away the sins which had rendered the
pursuit of excellence a wellnigh hopeless task. By
the impartation of his Spirit, no less than by the
inspiration of his Example, He seeks to win us to
the love of our neighbour, to fidelity in the discharge
of our daily duty, and to that cheerful and constant
trust in the providence of God by which we are redeemed
from the bondage of care and fear. He, the Immanuel,
by taking our flesh and dwelling among us, has <i>proved</i>
that "God is with us," that He will in very deed
dwell with men upon the earth. He, the Victor over
death, by his resurrection from the grave, has <i>proved</i>
the truth of a future life and a future judgment with
arguments of a force and quality unknown to our
Hebrew fathers.</p>

<p>So that now as of old, now even more demonstrably
than of old, the conclusion of the whole matter is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
we "fear God and keep his commandments." This is
still the one solution of "the common problem" and
"the whole duty of man." He who accepts this solution
and discharges this duty has achieved the Supreme
Quest; to him it has been given to find the Chief
Good.</p>

In his recent exposition of Ecclesiastes, the Dean of Wells
attempts to bring the date down to about <small>B.C.</small> 240. But his
arguments are so curious and fanciful, and his conclusion is
based so largely on conjecture, and on dubious similarities of
phrase in the language of the Hebrew Preacher, and of some of
the later philosophers of Greece, that I suspect very little weight
will be attached to his gallant attempt to breathe new life into
the moribund hypothesis of the ingenious Mr. Tyler. Delitzsch,
for example, a high and recognized authority, declares that there
is "not a trace of Greek influence" in this Scripture, though
Dr. Plumptre finds so many. But though neither his hypothesis
nor his confessedly conjectural biography of the unknown author
carries the force of "sober criticism," there is much in his Commentary
which will be found very helpful.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In the Book of Proverbs, for instance, he would find, in
addition to the incomparable personification of Wisdom to which
I have already referred, many examples of the proverb proper,
many detached sayings whose underlying thought is illustrated
by a stroke of imagination; such as that (chap. xxv. 11) in which
the enhanced beauty of an appropriate word when spoken at the
opportune moment is compared with the golden fruit of the
orange when set in its frame of silver blooms (<i>Expositions</i>, vol.
iv.). He would also find some of those small picturesque
descriptions produced by an artistic sequence of proverbs&mdash;the
same theme being sometimes worked over by different artists, in
different ages, one and the same moral being enforced by
wholly different designs; as, for instance, where Solomon (chap.
vi. 6-11) enforces the duty of a forethoughtful industry by a
picture of the ant and her prudent ways; while an unknown sage
of a later date (chap. xxiv. 30-34) appends precisely the same
moral, expressed in the same words, to his graphic picture of
the Sluggard's garden (<span class="smcap">The Expositor</span>, <i>Second Series</i>, vol. vi.).
Moreover, if he turn to chapter xxx. he will see how this form
of art, which once soared so high, was capable of sinking into a
kind of puerile conundrum&mdash;with its three too wonderful things,
and its four little things which yet are wise&mdash;while its moral tone
remained pure and high. And, finally, in the exposition of the
Epilogue to Ecclesiastes he will find how, after sinking so low,
it rose once more, in the hands of the later rabbis, into many
beautiful forms of fable, and exhortation, and parable.</p></div>

faith. All the imaginative races of antiquity conceived of a
being more divine than man, though originally not equal to the
gods, who guided the departed soul on its lonely journey through
the dark interspaces of death. Theut conducted the released
spirit of the Egyptian to the judgment-seat. Hermes performed
the same kind office for the Greeks, Mercury for the Romans.
Yama was the <i>nekropompos</i> of the Hindus, and the Persians
retained the legend. The Rig-Veda represents him as the first
man who passed through death to immortality, and as therefore
the best guide of other men. Nor is it doubted that the Persians
derived their belief in a future life from the primitive Hindu
creed. If their faith was, as I have said, a revolt from the degenerate
forms of Hindu worship, it was also a return to its more
ancient forms, as religious reformations are apt to be. The fathers
of the Aryan stock had an unwavering assurance of a future life.
In his Essay on the <i>Funeral Rites of the Brahmans</i>, Max Müller
cites a sort of liturgy with which the ancient Hindu used to bid farewell
to his deceased friend while the body lay on the funeral pyre,
which is, surely, very noble and pathetic: "Depart thou, depart
thou by the ancient paths, to the place whither our fathers have
departed. Meet with the ancient ones (the Pitrs); meet with
the Lord of Death; obtain thy desires in heaven. Throw off
thine imperfections; go to thy home. Become united with a
body; clothe thyself in a shining form. Go ye; depart ye;
hasten ye from hence" (Rig-Veda x. 14).
</p><p>
To which, as choral responses, might be added, "Let him
depart to those for whom flow the rivers of nectar. Let him
depart to those who through meditation have obtained the
victory, who by fixing their thoughts on the unseen have gone
to heaven.... Let him depart to the mighty in battle, to the
heroes who have laid down their lives for others, to those who
have bestowed their goods on the poor" (Rig-Veda x. 154).
</p><p>
As the body was consumed on the pyre the friends of the
dead chanted a hymn in which, after having bidden his body
return to the various elements from which it sprang, they prayed,
"As for his unborn part, do Thou, Lord (Agni), quicken it with
Thy heat; let Thy flame and Thy brightness kindle it: convey it
to the world of the righteous."
</p><p>
It was from this pure and lofty source that the Persians drew
their faith in the better life to be.
</p><p>
Max Müller also quotes as the prayer of a dying Hindu woman,
"Place me, O Pure One, in that everlasting and unchanging
world where light and glory are found. Make me immortal in
the world in which joys, delights, and happiness abide, where
the desires are obtained" (Atharda Veda xii. 3, 17).
</p><p>
Cremation itself bore witness to the Hindu faith in immortality,
since they held that "the fire which set free the spiritual element
from the superincumbent clay, completed the third or heavenly
birth," the second birth having been achieved when men set
themselves to a faithful discharge of their religious duties.</p></div>

and little minds find here below a nourishment which suffices
for their intellect and satisfies their love. They do not discover
the emptiness of visible things because they are incapable of
sounding them to the bottom. But a soul which God has drawn
nearer to the Infinite very soon feels the narrow limits within
which it is pent; it experiences moments of inexpressible sadness,
the cause of which for a long time remains a mystery; it
even seems as though some strange concurrence of events must
have chanced in order thus to disturb its life; and all the while
the trouble comes from a higher source. In reading the lives of
the Saints, we find that nearly all of them have felt that sweet
melancholy of which the ancients said <i>that there was no genius
without it</i>. In fact, melancholy is inseparable from every mind
that looks below the surface and every heart that feels profoundly.
Not that we should take complacency in it, for it is a malady that
enervates when we do not shake it off; and it has but two
remedies&mdash;<i>Death or God</i>." Elsewhere, still quite in the spirit of
the Preacher, he says: "Every day I feel more and more that
all is vanity. <i>I cannot leave my heart in this heap of mud.</i>"</p></div>

Belvedere, as Josephus informs us (<i>Antiq.</i>, VIII. 7, 3). Thither
it was the custom of the king, he says, to resort when he made
his morning excursions from the city, clad in a white garment,
and driving his chariot, surrounded by his body-guard of young
men in the flower of their age, clad in Tyrian purple, and with
gold dust strewed upon their hair, so that their whole head
sparkled when the sun shone upon it, and mounted upon horses
from the royal stables, famed for their beauty and fleetness."&mdash;Dr.

Job (chap. xxvii., vv. 15, 16), "This is the doom of the wicked

look upon all his host." A throne was erected for him on a hill
near Abydos, sitting on which he looked down and saw the
Hellespont covered with his ships, and the vast plain swarming
with his troops. As he looked, he wept; and when his uncle
Artabanus asked him the cause of his tears, he replied: "There
came upon me a sudden pity when I thought of the shortness of
man's life, and considered that of all this host, so numerous as it
is, not one will be alive when a hundred years are gone by."
This is one of the most striking and best known incidents in the
life of the Persian despot; but the rejoinder of Artabanus, though
in a far higher strain, is less generally known. I quote it here
as an illustration of the Preacher's mood. Said Artabanus: "And
yet there are sadder things in life than that. Short as our time
is, there is no man, whether it be here among this multitude or
elsewhere, who is so happy as not to have felt the wish&mdash;I will
not say once, but full many a time&mdash;that he were dead rather
than alive. Calamities fall on us, sicknesses vex and harass us,
and make life, short though it be, to appear long. <i>So death,
through the wretchedness of our life, is a most sweet refuge to
our race.</i>"&mdash;<i>Herodotus</i>, Book VII., c. 46.</p></div>

"Do you think, Sacian, that I live with more pleasure the more

that I have to guard more, to distribute to others, and have
the trouble of taking care of more; for a great many attendants

dispels fear, sleep drives away wine, and death sweeps all away&mdash;even
sleep. But Solomon the Wise says, Charity saves from
death." And there is hardly a finer passage in Shakespeare's

of Love, and its superiority to all change:

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> It may be worth while to specify some of the gross and
absurd conjectures, some also of the strange differences, into
which what may be called the <i>medical</i> reading of this passage
has betrayed its advocates. Ginsburg has a marvellous collection
of them in his "notes" to these verses. I select and combine
only a few of them. The darkening of the light, the sun, the
moon, and the stars (ver. 2) is taken by one great authority (the
Talmud) to mean the darkening <i>of the forehead</i>, <i>the nose</i>, <i>the soul</i>,
<i>and the teeth</i>; by another (the Chaldee Paraphrast), the obscuring
of <i>the face</i>, <i>the eyes</i>, <i>the cheeks</i>, <i>and the apples of the eyes</i>; by
a third (Dr. Smith, in his "Portraiture of Old Age"), <i>for the decay
of all the mental faculties</i>. That "the clouds return after the
rain" signifies, according to Ibn Ezra, <i>the constant dimness of the
eyes</i>; according to Le Clerc, <i>a bad influenza, accompanied with
unceasing snuffling</i>. "The keepers of the house" (ver. 3) are
<i>the ribs and the loins</i> (Talmud), <i>the knees</i> (Chaldee), and <i>the
hands and arms</i> (Ibn Ezra). "The men of power" are <i>the
thighs</i> (Talmud) and <i>the arms</i> (Chaldee). "The grinding maids"
are <i>the teeth</i>, and "the ladies who look out of the lattices" are <i>the
eyes</i>, by general consent. "The door closed on the street" is
<i>the pores of the skin</i> (Dr. Smith), <i>the lips</i> (Ibn Ezra), and <i>the eyes</i>
(Henstenberg). That "the noise of the mills ceases" or "grows
faint" (ver. 4) means that <i>the mastication of food</i> becomes imperfect
(Dr. Smith), that <i>the appetite</i> fails (Chaldee), that <i>the voice</i>
grows feeble (Grotius). That "the songbirds descend to their
nests" signifies that <i>music and songs are a bore</i> to the aged man
(Talmud), that he is <i>no longer able to sing</i> (Chaldee), that <i>his
ears are heavy</i> (Grotius). The allusion to "the almond" (ver. 5)
denotes that <i>the haunch-bone shall come out from leanness</i> (Talmud),
or (Reynolds) it denotes <i>the hoary hair which comes quickly
on a man</i> just as the almond-tree thrusts out her blossoms before
any other tree; while at least half-a-dozen scholars and physicians
take it as pointing to <i>membrum genitale</i> or <i>glans virilis</i>.
That "the locust becomes a burden" means that <i>the ankles
swell</i> (Chaldee), <i>gout in the feet</i> (Jerome), <i>a projecting stomach</i>
(Le Clerc), <i>the dry shrivelled frame of an old man</i> (Dr. Smith).
Almost all modern commentators take the reference to "the
caper-berry" as marking the fact that condiments lose their
power to provoke appetite with the aged, while many of the
ancients took it as marking the failure of sexual desire. The
"silver cord" and "golden bowl" of ver. 6 are <i>the tongue and
the skull</i> (Chaldee), <i>backbone and brain</i> (Dr. Smith), <i>urine and
bladder</i> (Gasper Sanctius); while the "bucket" is either <i>the gall</i>
or <i>the right ventricle of the heart</i>, and "the wheel" that draws
the water stands for <i>the air-inspiring lungs</i>.
</p><p>
Now of course it would not be just to condemn any interpretation
simply because it is weighted with absurdities and contradictions
such as these, though it surely requires a very strong
reading to carry them. But when an interpretation is so obviously
forced and fanciful, when it is so remarkably ingenious
and leaves to ingenuity so wide and lawless a scope, we shall do
well to hesitate before accepting it. And if another interpretation
be offered us, as in the text, which gives a literal rendering
to every phrase instead of a figurative one, which bases itself on
the common household facts of Eastern experience instead of on
the technicalities of Western science, which instead of being so
indeterminate and fanciful as at times to be self-contradictory
and grotesque, is coherent and impressive, we really have no
alternative before us. We cannot but choose the one and reject
the other.</p></div>

of Moses marked out as fit for human food. To this day several
kinds of locust are held to be an agreeable and nutritious diet.
There are many ways of preparing them for the table. They
may be pounded with flour and water, and made into cakes.
They may be smoked, boiled, roasted, stewed, and fried in butter.
They may be salted with salt; and thus treated are eaten by the
Arabs as a great delicacy. Or they may be dried in the sun, and
then steeped in wine: baskets of them, prepared in this way, are
to be commonly seen in Eastern markets. Dr. Kitto, who often
ate them, says that they taste like shrimps; Dr. Shaw says that
they are quite as good as our freshwater crayfish.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The caper-plant grows abundantly in Asia, as it does also
in Africa and Southern Europe. It commonly springs in the
crevices of walls, on heaps of ruins, or on barren wastes, and
forms a diffuse many-branched shrub. Its flowers are large and
showy: the four petals are white, but the long numerous stamens
have their filaments tinged with purple, and terminate in yellow
anthers. As the ovary ripens it droops and forms a pear-shaped
berry, which holds in its pulp many small seeds. Almost every
part of the shrub has been used as a condiment by the ancients.
The stalk and seed were salted, or preserved in vinegar or wine.
Its buds are still held to be an agreeable sauce&mdash;we eat them
with boiled mutton. And the berries possess irritant properties
which win them high esteem among the Orientals as a provocative
to appetite.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The fruit of the almond-tree is still reckoned one of the
most delicate and delicious fruits in the East. We may fancy
that we are acquainted with it, that we know "almonds" at least
as well as we know "raisins." But, I believe, that the almond
we eat is only the kernel of the stone in the true almond; the
fruit itself is of the same order with apricots, peaches, plums.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Sir Henry Rawlinson says: "At the present day, among the
<i>bons vivants</i> of Persia, it is usual to sit down for hours before
dinner, drinking wine, and eating dried fruits, such as filberts,
almonds, pistachio-nuts, melon-seeds, etc. A party, indeed, often
sits down at seven o'clock, and the dinner is not brought in till
eleven. The dessert dishes, intermingled as they are with highly
seasoned delicacies, are supposed to have the effect of stimulating
the appetite."&mdash;Notes to Rawlinson's <i>Herodotus</i>, vol. i., p. 274.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> It should be borne in mind that the comparative rarity of
thunderstorms in Syria and the adjacent lands makes them much
more dreadful to the inhabitants of those countries. Throughout
the Old Testament, and especially in the Psalms, we find many
traces of the dread which such storms inspired&mdash;a dread almost
unaccountable to our accustomed nerves.</p></div>

known of the history of this period. Roughly speaking, I believe
the Jews owed their literary advance mainly to contact with the
inquisitive and learned Babylonians, and their religious advance
mainly to the sorrows of the Captivity and their contact with the
pure faith of the primitive Persians.</p></div>

by many as an irreparable loss. The passage will be found in
his celebrated article on <i>The Talmud</i> in <i>The Quarterly</i> of
October 1867. "The Quest of the Chief Good" was published
at the close of that year. And at this point in it, while Deutsch
was still alive, but before I knew him personally, I gently complained
of the loss he had unwittingly inflicted on me. I had
for ten years been collecting the gnomic sayings of the Talmud
from any quarter open to one to whom the Talmud itself was a
sealed book, and had indeed printed some two score of them in
the <i>Christian Spectator</i> for 1866. And here came one who "out
of his profuse wealth carelessly flung down most of <i>my</i> special
treasures." Only half-a-dozen of the sayings I had collected
now had any stamp of novelty on them to the thousands who
had revelled in the wit and learning of that famous article in
<i>The Quarterly</i>. And of these I ventured to call special attention
to four which seemed to me of special value and beauty; viz.,
those on the four kinds of students, on new and old flasks, on
not serving God for the sake of reward, and on doing God's will
as if it were our will: they will all be found in this Section.
But if I lost something, I also gained much by the appearance
of that article, as those who read what follows will discover,
although it only came into my hands as I was correcting the
proofs of the final pages in my Book.</p></div>

in the Confucian <i>Analects</i>, book xv., chap. xxiii. "Tsze-kung
asked, saying, 'Is there one word which may serve as a rule
of practice for all one's life?' The Master said, 'Is not <i>reciprocity</i>
such a word? What you do not want done to yourself,
do not do to others.'" The same rule is given in another form
in book v., chap. i of the <i>Analects</i>. The other phrases
put into the sage's mouth are quoted from Dr. Legge's translation
of this work.</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
